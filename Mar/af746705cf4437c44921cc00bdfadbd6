A perennial sales underachiever with often less than 40 units being moved month-after-month, Mitsubishi has restructured the Triton line-up to accommodate a new entry-level model brandishing the GL nomenclature. Introduced in response to “overwhelming interest” according to the three-diamonds, the GL omits certain features offered on the unbadged, step-up model as well as the off-road focused Xtreme, namely leather seats, 18-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, seven airbags and rain sense wipers to name a few.

Underneath the bonnet, the 2.4 DI-D turbodiesel engine prevails, but with outputs lowered from 133kW/430Nm to 100kW/324Nm. Also not offered is the option of four-wheel-drive as the GL features a rear-wheel-drive layout with the only transmission option being a six-speed manual. Claimed fuel consumption is eight-litres/100 km. Included in the GL’s price is a three-year/100 000 km warranty as well as a five-year/90 000 km service plan. For more information, click here.
