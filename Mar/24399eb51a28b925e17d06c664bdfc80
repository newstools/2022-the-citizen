Turffontein Inside Track Best Bet: Race 2: Swinger – Integrate (2) and Sonnenstrahl (3) There have been two relevant scratchings in this race and it really appears to have turned itinto a two-horse race. These two have the best form in the field and should fight it out. The Swinger is the safe way to go but the other option is two take each Exacta – 2×3 and 3x– but then they have to finish first and second. Value Bet:  Race 5: Humdinger (11) eachway This horse had very good form in Durban and he has since joined Mike de Kock’s yard on theHighveld. He ran a very decent second over 1600m at this this track on debut and this1450m should be right up his street. He carries just 53.5kg and has Richard Fourie up. Those are the plentiful pros – the con is that he is drawn wide which can be an issue at this track.But at 7-1, he looks attractive value and with a top jockey up he is worth backing eachway.
