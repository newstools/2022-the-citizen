The news that larger crowds can return to racecourses gets an appropriate celebration at Turffontein on Saturday with the running of a high-quality, highly competitive Colorado King Stakes (Grade 2) over the Standside track’s 2000m. Every one of the 10 runners is a proven top-rank performer and would grace any elite race in the land. The lowest merit rating is 105. All that’s missing are some thrusting three-year-olds – but that’s because they’re otherwise engaged in the Highveld’s upcoming Derby day. Vying for the top of the betting are four-year-old emerging stars Shangani and Sparkling Water, a colt and a filly with win records of five from seven and six from 12 respectively.

A very uncharacteristic dull effort from Second Base in the Summer Cup – altogether a topsy-turvy form outlier – was followed by the fitting of blinkers and a snap back to familiar excellence with victory in the London News. Trainer Johan Janse van Vuuren then took Second Base to Cape Town for the Met and the gelding was far from disgraced when running on to finish five lengths off the amazing Kommetdieding. A second in an 1800m Pinnacle Stakes at Turffontein a month ago was a perfect tune-up for this – with big-race rider Keagan de Melo partnering for the first time and getting to know his mount. Mike de Kock-trained Sparkling Water was all class in annexing the 2800m Western Cape Stayers on Met day, demonstrating her wonderful versatility and putting up a hand (hoof?) for the title of best female horse in the country. Paul Peter’s Shangani, Sean Tarry’s duo of sometime Summer Cup champ Zillzaal and in-form Shango, and Ashley Fortune’s Majestic Mozart all have persuasive arguments for inclusion in all bets. Even the longer shots have credible claims. Two juvenile features – the Protea and Pretty Polly Stakes – are supporting features with exciting line-ups, providing fine fare for fans eager to get back on course to experience the thrilling sounds and smells of racehorses.
