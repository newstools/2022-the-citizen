The 44th Cape Town Cycle Tour is a wrap and the winners have been announced. Congratulations to everyone who dared the cold weather today. To add to an already arduous 109-km route around Cape Town’s iconic Table Mountain, cyclists also had to contend with wet and windy weather conditions. The participants, however, would not let a few raindrops dampen their enthusiasm, especially since the last race was held virtually due to Covid-19 restrictions.  Speaking ahead of the race, Tour director David Bellairs the there was “an incredible vibe in Cape Town” in the lead up to the event.  “You can sense that things are kind of returning to normal. We were limited to 22,500 entries so as you can imagine we are excited because we are heading back where we need to be”.  Team Qhubeka’s Marc Pritzen was crowned as the victor in the men’s division, with Sasha Weber, HB Kruger and Byron Munton following hot on Pritzen’s wheels.  Pritzen clocked in at 02:37:55. However, all odds were on Kruger to walk away with the prize.
