PSL prosecutor, Zola Majavu had previously said the arbitrator’s ruling would be final and they would pursue the matter any further. “Kaizer Chiefs are pleased that justice has been served by the arbitration ruling handed down at SAFA on Friday afternoon by Advocate Nazeer Cassim SC,” reads Chiefs’ statement.  “(This) after the club challenged the league’s decision to charge Amakhosi for being unable to fulfill two fixtures due to a massive Covid-19 outbreak that befell us in December 2021. “The decision we took to request the postponement of matches late last year was in the interest of safety for all concerned, our families, football colleagues and all the stakeholders involved in the game. “And, now that the matches will be played, it is in the interest of football that points should be won or lost through matches played on the field of play as opposed to the boardrooms. “We want to thank everyone who supported our cause. We are also grateful this ruling will return the value to our sponsors, Amakhosi supporters and the League’s sponsors. “We truly feel vindicated by the decision and look forward to playing the two outstanding DStv Premiership matches.”  The PSL are yet to respond to the outcome of the arbitration, but they are unlikely to take the matter any further.
