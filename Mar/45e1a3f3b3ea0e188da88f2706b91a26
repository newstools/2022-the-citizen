Durbanville Best Bet: Double: Race 1 Pucallpa (10) and Race 2 Wecangoallnight (10) One could get 10 out of 10 with this bet. Both horses stand out in their respective races and the double looks the way to go. For the brave, one could make it a Pick 3 and add No 3 Charlie Malone into the bet in Race 3. He is the best horse of those who have run, and while there are a couple of unknown first-timers in the field, they will have to be good to beat him. Value Bet:  Race 5 quartet: Double float Van Hunks (2) and Service Ace (4) with the field Good form at Durbanville is often a useful tool when studying form at the course, and both of these runners have won at Durbanville. This is an open race and that factor is sure to play a role. Only nine horses will go to post and the cost of a full bet is R504, but one can take 10% for R50.40.
