Durban-based Emer-G-Med paramedics rushed a 50-year-old man to the nearest hospital after he was allegedly shot. The victim sustained gunshot wounds to his head after a hijacking incident this morning, in the Isipingo area south of Durban. Emer-G-Med found the man in a critical condition. He was therefore stabilised before he was placed onto a mechanical ventilator. “Several advanced life support interventions were needed to stabilise him before he was placed onto a mechanical ventilator to assist him in breathing. The call was then made for the assistance of the Netcare911 aeromedical helicopter to airlift him through to a specialist facility for the definitive care that he required,” paramedics said. This follows an incident of a professor being shot and killed.
