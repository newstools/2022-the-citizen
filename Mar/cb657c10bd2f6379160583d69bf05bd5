Tebogo Langerman is still out of the team at Swallows FC and Phakaaathi has learnt that he may cut ties with the Soweto side. As we previously reported, Langerman had not been paid since November last year when he decided to stop going to training at the Dube Birds. He told his teammates and the club that he didn’t have money for petrol.

The team needs his experience especially after (Thabo) Matlaba also left. They are now using a right footed player at left back and the crosses are not coming while they have (Mwape) Musonda who would benefit from his supply,”  said a source.
