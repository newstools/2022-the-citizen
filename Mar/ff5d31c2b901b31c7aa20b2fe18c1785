The Bulls kept climbing the United Rugby Championship log at the weekend, overtaking the Sharks as their emphatic 55-20 win over the Dragons at Loftus Versfeld lifted them to seventh place, but coach Jake White, although satisfied, still wants them to up their game. “You’ve got to be proud of that performance. The way we are playing is nice and there’s good interplay between the backs and forwards,” White said.

We’re not the finished product yet, but there is a lot to be happy about,” he added. “We can still get better in all areas, although we are scrumming well, the maul is working and the backs are scoring tries. But to win this competition, we need to be better at everything.” The well-travelled World Cup winning coach gave credit to his team for getting the balance right between attack and defence, while heaping special praise on fullback Kurt-Lee Arendse, whose second try from 70 metres out is surely going to be a contender for try of the year. “I really enjoyed the way we would score and then exit to halfway, it was clinical and well-executed. We want to get a balanced game and the balance is working right now,” White said. “It helps to have a phenomenal fullback like Kurt-Lee. He’s not only scoring amazing tries but also kicks the ball 50-60 metres. “He complements Harold Vorster and Lionel Mapoe, who are playing very well in midfield.”
