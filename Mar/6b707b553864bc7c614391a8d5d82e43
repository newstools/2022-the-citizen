Rand Water has announced that the planned H12 pipeline shutdown, that was meant to take place today, has been postponed. Spokesperson of Rand Water Justice Mohale said all planned water shutdowns have been postponed until further notice. The pipeline project was set to take place at Glen Austin, Midrand, inside the Randjesfontein Estate. This comes after they had halted a shutdown for their F34 and F46 pipelines which was scheduled from 5am on 23 March to 5am on 24 March 2022. Rand water has warned of a significant water reduction during a planned H12 pipeline shutdown by the end of March. A reduction of approximately 50% of water is to be expected, the utility said. The planned shutdown of its H12 pipeline was scheduled from 31 March at 7am to 1 April at 10:30am. The 39.5-hour shutdown was aimed at tying in a 5.2km x 170mm section of the newly constructed H39 pipeline which has been constructed to augment a portion of the H12 pipeline.
