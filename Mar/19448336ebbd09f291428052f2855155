Aldo Domeyer will be driving into the Western Cape countryside on Wednesday morning with expectations of a good day at Durbanville racecourse. The ace jockey has money prospects in every one of the eight races on the programme – and winning chances in many. As stable rider to trainer Candice Bass-Robinson, Domeyer partners her best runners and she, too, looks in good shape for the meeting. The duo could get into the winner’s circle as soon as Race 2 with Don Reposado, but the more likely first chalk-up is in Race 3 with Silent War. The three-year-old has been runner-up in his last three races and it will be a big relief for the stable and his illustrious owners if he lands his maiden at last. As this is a maiden handicap, Silent War must carry top weight of 60kg – thanks to his merit rating of 76, courtesy of seven placings in his eight runs. The conditions bring apparently lesser horses into the equation, such as Electric Warrior, who carries just 53kg. However, Silent War still looks the classiest contender and will start at cramped odds. Golden Dah in Race 5 and Raising Quin in Race 6 offer a bit more return on investment for followers of the Domeyer-Bass-Robinson alliance. Then in the seventh, Domeyer switches allegiance to Piet Botha’s yard, hopping onto the splendidly named Ragnar Lothbrok, who appears to be coming to hand again after a short break to celebrate his maiden win in November. In the last race, the jockey does duty for Piet Steyn on sprinter What A Man, a consistent sprinter who is sure to give a run for money. The message is: Aldo all day.
