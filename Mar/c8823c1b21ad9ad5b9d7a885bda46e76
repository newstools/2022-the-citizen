A car stolen ten years ago was recovered by an alert police officer, after spotting it parked in one of Carletonville’s busiest streets. While on a routine patrol last week, the officer spotted suspicious individuals in a white Volkswagen Golf, Carletonville police communication officer warrant officer Peter Masooa told Carletonville/Fochville Herald. Masooa said his colleague was driving through Annan Road in the afternoon when he approached the suspects. He then asked to search them and the vehicle. While comparing the information on a tag in the car with the licence disk, the officer found it did not match. He then noticed two licence disks on the car’s windscreen, and searched the information on the other disc as well. It was then he discovered the car was in fact stolen more than 80 kilometres away, in Florida, Johannesburg, in 2012. The men were promptly arrested, and the car confiscated.   ALSO READ: Police nab three suspects for allegedly smuggling motorbikes to Mozambique Meanwhile, three suspects were arrested in Mpumalanga over the weekend for allegedly smuggling motorbikes and motorcycle parts to Mozambique.
