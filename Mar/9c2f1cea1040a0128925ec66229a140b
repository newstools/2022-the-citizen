AmaZulu FC’s run in the Caf Champions League is almost over – it is now reliant on other team’s results.  This is after the Durban side’s 2-0 loss to Raja Casablanca at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday night. Usuthu needed to eke out at least a draw to have a realistic chance at advancing past the group stages.

They will now hope that Horoya beats or holds ES Setif to a draw later on Friday night.  Added to that, they will need to beat Horoya away and hope Raja does the same to ES Setif to have advance – typical of a South African team, right?  Things went south early for AmaZulu when they allowed the Moroccans to have what they needed – an early goal. It came through Hamid Ahadad in the sixth minute.  Raja could have doubled their lead a few minutes later and AmaZulu also had their chances although nothing clear cut.  Usuthu came back for the second half looking a lot more determined but they found Raja resolute at the back and looking to catch them on a counter-attack.  And it happened in the 77th minute when Ahadad completed his brace, benefitting from Usuthu’s aimless defending.  In a Group A match, Al Ahly beat El-Merreikh 3-1 to jump back to second place behind Mamelodi Sundowns and keep their hopes alive.  Pitso Mosimane’s side are now on seven points and will need a draw in their last game against Al Hilal of Sudan to advance to the next round,
