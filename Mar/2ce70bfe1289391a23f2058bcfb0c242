I’m sure every Pirates fan thinks the team can go all the way to lift the trophy, it can happen. Anything is possible in this competition and we really need to applaud the guys for their effort and commitment that they have displayed.”“To tell you the truth, Pirates has the squad to compete and to be counted among the best clubs in the continent, we have the players, we have the technical team and they have the support from management. So, we shouldn’t really be surprised by their achievement.”The Buccaneers reached the last eight of the tournament las tseason, only to be knocked out Raja Casablanca.Mothibi seems to think that Pirates are much more experienced this time around and that consistency in the line-up and good team spirit might help to win the trophy.“Last season it was hard, the team was really under pressure and seeing them playing in the quarterfinals was a big thin, because no one gave them a chance. Even this season, I don’t think people expected Pirates to be where they are when the tournament started because they have been really poor in the league (DStv Premiership). But … they have the experience.”
