Greyville Poly Best Bet RACE 4 NO  2 SHAVOUT – WIN This horse will be having his first run with a new trainer and is reported to be working very well. He was highly regarded by his previous trainer and perhaps the change in scenery will make all the difference. He is at a decent price of 5-2. Value Bet RACE 7 QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT NO 1-GODDESS OF LIGHT AND 2-TRAVELLING LIGHT WITH THE FIELD. A nice open race and we have gone for Goddess Of Light, trained by visiting trainer Paul Peter and ridden by Warren kennedy, and Travelling light, that combines the lethal duo of trainer Garth Puller and jockey Anton Marcus. As this is very open one needs to include the remaining 10 runners in the bet. All that has to happen is both horses must run in the first four and then you will collect.
