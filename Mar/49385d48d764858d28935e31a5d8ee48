Fairview Polytrack Best Bet: Race 4: To The Max (5) to win. This Judpot mare is having her first outing in her new surroundings. All four her career victories have come on the Greyville Polytrack and she looks set to add her name to the growing list of horses who excel when relocating to Gqerberha. Value Bet:  Race 5: Wangan Midnight (8) to win. Not the most consistent, this Querari gelding is a knit-one-slip-one type. But he’s having his second run after a rest and could give trainer Tara Laing a double. Consider playing a double with the best bet and value bet.
