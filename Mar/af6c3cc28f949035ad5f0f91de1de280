Former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates striker Lehlohonolo Majoro is said to be trying to convince the AmaZulu management that he should have his contract extended, but, it doesn’t seem like they will. According to a source, Majoro is on his last months with Usuthu and contract renewals with the club haven’t even started.

The guys at the top don’t even want to talk about contracts of the players at the moment, especially a player like Majoro because he comes with huge demands and he is one of the senior player at the club. “We will see what happens, everyone is still trying to figure things out after coach Benni left, we really don’t know what is going to happen,” said the source.
