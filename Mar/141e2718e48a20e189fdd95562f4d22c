This was after the mother of his son made it clear to him that she was not interested in a romantic relationship with him anymore. “He failed to bring the child back until Sunday, 17 October 2021, when the mother got worried and asked family members to accompany her to Gift’s home to fetch the child,” Covane said on Wednesday. He said the 20-year-old mother made the painful discovery that Stander had strangled their child to death, with his lifeless body concealed under the bed “The police at Bloemspruit in Bloemfontein were called to the scene, the case docket for murder was opened and the accused was arrested. “Warrant Officer Moeketsi Solomon Mokgobo received the docket and even though there were no witnesses, managed to get confession made in court by the accused.” NOW READ: Ambulance crew robbed at gunpoint in Alexandra
