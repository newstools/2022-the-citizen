Racing on Monday is on the Polytrack at Greyville. The card is the original Monday card. There could be confusion over this, as rain washed out Sunday’s turf track fixture at Greyville and an announcement was made that the Sunday card – including the Listed Kings Cup – would be moved to Monday. The Monday programme – at Greyville on Poly – would be abandoned. But rain kept bucketing down, there was a rethink and later on Sunday another announcement came: Sunday’s meeting would be scrapped, and the original Monday card raced on the Poly. As you were. The Kings Cup has been moved to a fixture at Scottsville next weekend. Trainer Duncan Howells brings three runners from his base at Ashburton and will have hopes of ending a lean spell with a winner. Straight Up, who he saddles for in-form jockey Kyle Strydom in Race 6, might be his best – although rival Congo Compaq has some wet weather credentials. Irish Belle in the seventh also has a shout for Howells, particularly with prolific S’Manga Khumalo in the irons, while Quest For the Best in the eighth is a much longer shot, but does have yet another on-song rider, Keagan de Melo, on board.
