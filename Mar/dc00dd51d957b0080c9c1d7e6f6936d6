The Gauteng Health Department says it is prioritising the reopening of the emergency unit at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital (CMJAH). MEC for health Dr Nomathemba Mokgethi ensured the public that the work at the hospital will be done as quickly as possible, to get the unit running again. Mokgethi did not give an update of when the emergency unit will be operational again.  After the emergency unit was damaged by a fire on 16 April 2021, the public and the health sector have been concerned about the delays in rebuilding that part of the hospital. Meanwhile, the vandalism done to CMJAH has brought about delays in the refurbish process. “The work to complete the casualty section suffered a setback recently due to theft of copper piping, electrical wiring and circuit breakers from the works and disruption of the site by the local community,” Dr Mokgethi said in the statement.
