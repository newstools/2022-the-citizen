Zuma ended up being suspended by the club following that incident and he has since been kept under the radar. The 26-year-old made his return to the Amakhosi match day squad in the 1-0 loss to Golden Arrows last Saturday, but did not play in the game.  “Everything that is happening now is because we know what needs to be done. There was a point where the management wanted to get rid of him, but there were a few who thought that it wouldn’t be wise to let a player like him go,” a source told the Mgosi Squad. “But you know such things happen. The thing is that Zuma is a young player, these things happen. He is a different player and a different person now since the suspension he got from the club. He knows that he has to behave like a top professional because he represents us.”
