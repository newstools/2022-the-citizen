However, this action is said to be dependent on how things are going to unfold in terms of if there will be any changes in the technical team. “Look, there will be a lot of changes in the squad, I think everyone is anticipating that looking at how things have been going at the club. “The management is not happy at all and they have been raving about this for a while now. It’s very bad, especially for players who aren’t playing, (but) there are others who have been playing and they are also on the list. So, a lot of people will be shocked by the players who will be leaving, because some of these guys are players who were bought with a lot of money and there was a lot expected from them. But they haven’t delivered and they (management) don’t really see the need to keep them. There are guys like Ndlovu and Makgaka who are on the list.,” said the insider.
