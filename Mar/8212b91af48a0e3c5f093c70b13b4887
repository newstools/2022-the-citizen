Van Nistelrooy, who also scored 35 goals in 70 games for the Netherlands, joined Frank de Boer’s Dutch coaching staff as an assistant at the 2020 Euros.  He was also assistant coach of the Dutch national team from 2014 to 2016. “We are delighted to confirm that Ruud van Nistelrooy is our new manager,” said PSV director of football John de Jong. “He is a strong, inspirational leader and his commitment and work ethic will be second to none.” PSV are currently in second place behind Ajax in the Dutch Eredivisie. Meanwhile, Portuguese football media is reporting that Schmidt was close to signing a deal with Benfica, who earlier this month stunned Ajax with a last-minute goal to reach the Champions League quarter finals.
