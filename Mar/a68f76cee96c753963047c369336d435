Leading Highveld trainer Paul Peter means business with the six horses he takes to Durban on Monday. All six looks likely to enjoy galloping on the Polytrack at Greyville and all look primed for a win. The filly Zanetto in the last race, an MR70 Handicap over 1400m, is probably the pick of the Peter bunch and has been priced up accordingly by the bookmakers. The lightly raced four-year-old takes on males and must carry a hefty 60.5kg, but she has done similar before and done well. Class generally tells and this daughter of Silvano looks a cut above this opposition. Also, it’s her peak run after a short rest and she will have the assistance of Warren Kennedy, who she knows well. Peter also has a strong presence in Race 4, with the well-bred Grimaldi and Blue Moon City. It would be no surprise if these two were to fight out the finish as both have decent Highveld form that looks a tad superior to the local. Value opportunities among the Peter raiders are Space Race in the sixth and City By The Sea in the seventh.
