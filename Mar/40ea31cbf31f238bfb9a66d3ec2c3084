Phakaaathi has been informed that former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Siphelele Ntshangase is most likely to return to Black Leopards at the start of the next season, as the club are believed to be willing to set their differences aside and bring the 28-year-old midfielder on board. “Stash”, as the player is affectionately known, made his name with Lidoda Duvha before moving to Limpopo rivals Baroka FC.

I am tempted to say he was cursed when stepped out of the door but now, the club are willing to welcome him back and give him a chance because things are not working out for him, he even warms the bench at Marumo Gallants,” said a source.
