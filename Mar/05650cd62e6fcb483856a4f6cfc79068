The in-form duo of Candice Bass-Robinson and Aldo Domeyer can get punters off to a flying start at Durbanville on Tuesday, helping them build a war chest for when the going gets tougher later in the afternoon. Juvenile filly Who Do You Love looked a cut above the average when she trotted up on debut just more than a month ago and could reprise that performance for the Bass-R0binson-Domeyer combo over the same 1000m trip in Race 1. The trainer and jockey go with Dancetildaylight in the second, a Progress Plate for fillies over 1600m. This one has been racing in features of late – even at Grade 1 level – so should have the measure of most of the opposition here. The one exception to that comment is Justin Snaith-trained Really Royal, who has also been consorting with superior company recently and could revel in this lesser class. Bass-Robinson and Domeyer re-enter the battlefield in Race 4, a 1260m Maiden Plate, with Tchaikovsky, a three-year-old who has just been gelded. The cut might be what he needs to get the son of Pomodoro more focused – after he has shown hints of talent in five outings to date. His principal threat is Piet Steyn-trained Boisterous Buddy, who got on well with veteran rider Bernard Fayd’Herbe last time and turned in his best career showing by placing second in a 1000m dash. Aeneas in the sixth is the trainer-jockey team’s next best, with Adios Amigos having an outside shout in the last.
