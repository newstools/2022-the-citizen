Yet it is only now, eight years later, that the suspects – alleged hitmen for hire – are going on trial,” explained Netflix in a statement.  “Were these five men involved,  or was it a cover-up for something more sinister? With the backing and participation of Senzo’s family and access to investigators and key witnesses, Senzo: Murder of a Soccer Star aims to unpack the truth behind this high-profile murder.” It is unclear whether or not Meyiwa’s then-girlfriend, Kelly Khumalo, will contribute to the documentary, however, she recently hosted a birthday party for the daughter she shares with Meyiwa, a little girl named Thingo.Thingo recently turned eight and has never known her father due to the tragic events of that night.  Compiled by Kaunda Selisho
