AmaZulu are believed to be still keen on landing Thamsanqa Gabuza from SuperSport United at the end of the season after Matsatsantsa A Pitori slapped a “not for sale” sign on him when they apparently approached them in January for the services of “Ganda Ganda”.

They admire Gabuza’s current form and feel he would fit well into Benni’s system,” said a source.Meanwhile, as previously reported, Phakaaathi has learnt that Orlando Pirates tried to ship troublesome midfielder Nkanyiso Zungu off to AmaZulu on loan but their advances were rejected.
