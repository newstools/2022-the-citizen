The Department of Communications and Digital Technologies said it has registered more than 1.4 million indigent applicants for government’s free decoder and installation. This comes ahead of the gazetted 31 March 2022 analogue switch-off and end of dual illumination in South Africa. The Department of Communications and Digital Technologies has commended the people of South Africa for their patience and embracing migration from analogue to digital. “The Department reiterates that of the 14 million TV-watching households in the country, 11.5 million have self-migrated as they watch TV through satellite and will therefore not be affected by the analogue switch off.” The department said the installation process continues countrywide, and more than 1.2 million households would have their free decoders before the analogue switch-off date. “Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni receives daily updates on the progress with STB installations,” the department said. South Africa began its broadcast migration plan shortly after 2006, setting itself a target to complete the process by 2011, but this was not to be.
