It is only after that game that I will then focus on Bafana,”  he adds.  “I didn’t expect to go back to France so soon… But I have good memories. Going back to see the stadiums I used to play in and the people I know from that country.  “It will be good to go back and share my experiences with the young boys. This is a new team and we are going to play one of the top teams in the world. They have good players who ply their trade in the biggest leagues. So, it will be good for us to go there and see how good we are.”
