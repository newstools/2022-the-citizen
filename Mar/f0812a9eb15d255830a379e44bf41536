When you feel that you are trying to stop a financial flood with a small bucket while new money problems are flooding out of an open ‘debt -tap’, it’s time to stop and take an honest look at what is causing your financial problems. The uncomfortable truth will probably be that your actions caused the flood. Millions of South Africans are ‘payday millionaires’, and that’s where money problems usually start. The only way to change is to understand that if you wish to do great things tomorrow, you must address today’s issues and take the steps needed to make them yesterday’s problems. When that payday cheque hits the bank, it’s time for a celebration. For many of us, this means heading for the closest restaurant, spending the money while the going is good, and there is enough money for the luxuries we enjoy. The problem is that we do this while knowing that within a week or so, we are going to be struggling, trying to fill the enormous money sinkhole that is standing between us, our next payday and renewed millionaire status. When you reach the point when the sinkhole is opening just after payday and debt is making life unbearable, there is only one survival course available, and that is taking hard decisions and changing your lifestyle from the ground up. Basically, stopping the flood from the wide-open debt tap means wading through the debt and turning off the tap. Only then can the mopping up truly begin. It is also important to realise that once the hard work is underway and recovery is on the horizon, the best way to stop repeating costly mistakes is to empower yourself, assume responsibility for your decisions and equip yourself with the financial education needed to create positive futures for you and your family.  Live a life of the investment and not a life of consumption. NOW READ: More people seeking help with debt
