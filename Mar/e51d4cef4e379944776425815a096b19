Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula on Tuesday told Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) that the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) has been scammed by 3,000 ghost workers. Mbalula said Prasa, in December, became aware that it was paying full salaries to the ghost workers. The rail agency has since stopped the salary payments. Since then, according to the minister, nobody at Prasa has come forward to complain that they didn’t receive their salary. “Somebody has created a scam to steal money from the organisation. That’s how broken Prasa is. … in a normal company, you can’t even afford to have one ghost worker, and we have 3,000,” said Mabalula. Mbalula called the 3,000 ghost workers a “grand scam” and said it was uncovered during the Operation Ziveze campaign which was implemented to uncover irregularities at the state-owned entity.

A number of critical positions are currently occupied by acting incumbents.  Among the vacant positions that need to be filled are a Group CEO, a Chief Human Capital Officer, the Chief Procurement Officer and the Prasa Rail CEO.
