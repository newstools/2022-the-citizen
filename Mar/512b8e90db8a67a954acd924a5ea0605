The Kremlin on Thursday denied US and British claims that President Vladimir Putin’s advisers are scared of giving him a true picture of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine. Putin launched the military operation in Ukraine on February 24 citing the “genocide” of Russian speakers there and accusing the pro-Western country of close ties with Nato.  “This shows that neither the Department of State nor the Pentagon have real information about what is happening in the Kremlin,” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.
