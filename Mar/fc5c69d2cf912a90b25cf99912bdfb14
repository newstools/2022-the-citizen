We had been back and forth about it. The team is happy, and I am happy; that’s more important,” said Mosimane.  “The duration of the contract doesn’t mean you will stay until then (2024). If you keep winning, of course, [you will stay until then] but if you don’t win then the contract is different. “The contract is just good for disputes in case we divorce then you go to the paper. “It’s just not a mere contract but a contract for the team that plays in all the tournaments on the continent until the end. “So, where do you want to go if you don’t want to stay here? Unless you move over the continent then it’s a different setup but beyond the borders, you have a challenge with the Europeans; they come from big teams in the gulfs,” Mosimane added.
