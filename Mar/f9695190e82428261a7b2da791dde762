Phakaaathi has been led to believe that the real reason behind Cavin Johnson’s departure from Egyptian giants Al-Ahly was because he allegedly could not cope with the demands of head coach Pitso Mosimane. Johnson was Mosimane’s first assistant at the Red Devils, but he decided to vacate his post a few months into the job.
