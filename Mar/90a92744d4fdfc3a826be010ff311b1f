Social media has been gushing over a newly shared adorable video of DJ Zinhle and Bongani’s baby daughter Santy who seemed to have reserved feelings about her fathers musical skills. The producer shared the video on her personal Instagram and Twitter pages, where Murdah Bongz is seen using Santy’s toys to create some sort of musical tune for the six-month-old baby. What got Zinhle’s fans followers talking was Santy’s response to her fathers messy performance which made it seem as though she was very uninterested and unimpressed with the noise which her father was making for her.  The mother-of-two captioned the post, “Santy is definitely my child”.
