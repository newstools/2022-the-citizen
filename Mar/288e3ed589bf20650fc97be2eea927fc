Trade Union Solidarity will lay criminal charges against 19 people allegedly involved in state capture, including former president Jacob Zuma, at the Brooklyn police station in Pretoria. Other people that will have charges laid against them include former SAA chairperson, Dudu Myeni, former Transet and Eskom head, Brian Molefe, former chairperson of Denel, Daniel Mantsha and the former chief executive of Denel, Zwelakhe Ntsepe. Solidarity said it will file charges of corruption, theft, fraud and mismanagement of state funds against the accused on Tuesday. Morne Malan, the head of communications at the union, said that the charges to be laid by Solidarity will focus on the institutions that caused major damage to workers and Solidarity members.

Hermann said the Solidarity docket is the most comprehensive charge that has been submitted to the police thus far. The Jacob G Zuma Foundation said former president Jacob Zuma will consult with his legal team “on the appropriate course of action to be taken”, following his implication in the third state capture report. Zuma has been implicated in all three parts of the State Capture Commission reports. Judge Raymond Zondo based the findings in the latest report on the testimony of Angelo Agrizzi and other witnesses, who demonstrated that Bosasa used their access to ANC higher-ups.
