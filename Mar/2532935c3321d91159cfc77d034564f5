The South African National Road Agency SOC Ltd (Sanral) released a traffic advisory to notify road users to expect road closures on the N1 South bound between N1/R21 (Flying Saucer interchange) and Botha Avenue in Centurion. This is to allow for rehabilitation work on the sinkhole. The roadwork’s took effect on Tuesday, and will continue until next Monday.  According to Sanral’s Northern Regional Manager Progress Hlahla, the closure is required to allow for road marking in the lanes of the southbound carriageway. “The reconfiguration of the lanes is required to remark the road which has since been increased from three (3) lanes to four (4) to assist in alleviating traffic congestion,” Hlahla said. During this period only two lanes will be open. According to Sanral motorists should plan their trips according to the new route schedule or use alternative routes; and also alert road users when making use of the roads.

They do not only cause a great inconvenience for residents, but also have a negative impact on development and the value of property. The sinkholes form because of the large deposits of dolomite in the Centurion area. Heavy rainfall, water and sewer leaks, poor backfill on properties, storm water ponding, shifts caused by landslides, boreholes being drilled and buildings being erected all contribute to the risk of sinkholes forming.
