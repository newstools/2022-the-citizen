Rain In Holland has always looked hard to oppose in Saturday’s Grade 2 Wilgerbosdrift SA Oaks over 2450m at Turffontein, but her chances were further buoyed by the withdrawal of Perfect Witness at Tuesday’s declaration stage. The fields for the Oaks, the Grade 1 World Sports Betting SA Derby over 2450m and the Grade 1 Wilgerbosdrift HF Oppenheimer Horse Chestnut Stakes over 1600m were finalised on Tuesday and the other surprise was the withdrawal of Safe Passage, winner of the Grade 2 Gauteng Guineas and runner-up in the Grade 1 SA Classic. Rain In Holland, who is owned by Drakenstein Stud and trained by Sean Tarry, is now trading at 1-4 to win the Oaks and in doing so claim the Triple Tiara and the R1-million bonus that goes with it. Gutsy winner of the SA Classic Red Saxon stood his ground and as a result Joe Soma’s charge is now the 2-1 favourite to win the SA Derby. The field has been reduced to nine runners but, while Safe Passage will not be there, Mike de Kock will still have Aragosta in the field. While he disappointed in the SA Classic, the son of Rafeef is far better than that run and could put his best forward on this occasion. Kommetdieding will be taking his place in the Horse Chestnut Stakes with Gavin Lerena up while De Kock will have the main challenger in Al Muthana. There will be a R1-million Pick 6 carryover at the meeting with the pool likely to reach R5 million.
