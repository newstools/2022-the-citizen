As reported by Operation Dudula deputy chair Dan Radebe, Nhlanhla ‘Lux’ Dlamini was arrested just after his interview with KayaFM on Thursday afternoon.  Operation Dudula’s national secretary-general Zandile Dabula confirmed to PowerFM that Dlamini will appear at the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court on Friday morning. This after a case of breaking and entering was opened at the Dobsonville Police Station on Wednesday. The case was opened by Victor Ramerafe, who was accompanied by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), after Dlamini allegedly raided the home of the 59-year-old Ramerafe, in search for drugs.  Radebe said he did not understand why Dlamini had been singled out when there were a number of people during the alleged raid.

EFF national spokesperson Sinawo Tambo said it was not true that Ramerafe sold drugs.  He added the people who accused him were not from Dobsonville and that Dlamini had a “mobile renting” crowd, which pretended to be the “community” wherever he went. “He is a coward. He is not confronting gangsters in the harbours of this country, where drugs are imported from, he is going to innocent men and women because he is a coward,” he said on Wednesday.  “We want him to be arrested and if the police do not make an intervention on what Operation Dudula is doing in Johannesburg – which has already started spreading to other areas – then we will encourage our people to defend themselves.” Gauteng police could not be reached.
