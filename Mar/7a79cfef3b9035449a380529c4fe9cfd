The Zungus would go onto the pitch and celebrate with the team if we won or console them if things didn’t go well… But now they don’t do that,” said the source. Another source claimed that the last stroke for Sandile Zungu was when he spoke out on Siyethemba Sithebe not ever playing for his team after he signed a pre-contract with Kaizer Chiefs only for McCarthy to contradict him. “That fueled the tensions because Zungu took as to say that Benni would not take instructions from him and would do things his own way,” said the source.
