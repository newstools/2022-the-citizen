These are the world champions. It is not a shame for us to lose 5-0, we know why and the experience of playing was more valuable than the defeat.” Broos was impressed with the performance of Lyle Foster, even though Bafana’s attack had little joy against Les Bleus, while the Bafana head coach also praised central defensive pairing Siyanda Xulu and Nkosinathi Sibisi. “Lyle Foster … it was very difficult but for me he played a good game,” said Broos. “Xulu and Sibisi were also good but as a team we do not have enough quality to fight and be the equal of France.”
