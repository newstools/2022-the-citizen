It has been revealed that one of the reasons Pirates are not playing like a top side is differing views within the team by the people choosing the sides. “Everyone is just playing for their own benefit. I no longer see anyone playing for the team. The guys are just full of egos, I don’t understand. They like to gossip among each other and they even talk against one another. So, that is the thing – they don’t really like each other, they just like pretending. “The coaches have realised what is happening, but they can’t deal with it. But, anyway, that is another thing. I think that is why they want to let them go. Those guys can’t really control the team, they lack management skills, you just see it. There is no discipline within the squad and everyone is just doing as they want,” said a source.
