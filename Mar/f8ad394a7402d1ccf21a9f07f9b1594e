Tennis’ Grand Slam tournaments will all trial using a first-to-10 tie-break in final sets this year, the four competitions announced on Wednesday. Until now, the major events all employed different rules on how to end a match which reaches 6-6 in a deciding set. The Australian Open already uses a first-to-10 breaker, while the US Open has opted for a traditional first-to-seven tie-break at 6-6 for over 50 years. The French Open has still not used a final-set tie-break, although Wimbledon introduced a first-to-seven breaker at 12-12 in 2019. “The Grand Slam Board are pleased to announce the joint decision to play a 10-point tie-break at all Grand Slams, to be played when the score reaches six games all in the final set,” the organisers of the Grand Slams said in a statement. “The Grand Slam Board’s decision is based on a strong desire to create greater consistency in the rules of the game at the Grand Slams.” With the exception of the US Open, the Grand Slams had no final-set tie-breaks until three years ago. But there were calls for change after John Isner’s famous match against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon in 2010, which the American won 70-68 in a fifth set after more than 11 hours of play. The Grand Slam Board added they would review the trial before “applying for any permanent rule change”.
