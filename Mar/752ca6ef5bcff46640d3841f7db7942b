Orlando Pirates are at the top of the standings with 49 points from the exact number of games. With the race for the title seemingly out of their way, a good finish is what the two clubs will be looking and Moriri says he is anticipating a tough encounter. “We anticipate a very tough game but always interesting against Chiefs. Our games against Chiefs always have goals, very entertaining match. I know they are coming to us looking for points, but we also want the points. The players are ready, and they know what is at stake, they will not disappoint come Sunday,” said the Downs reserves coach. Meanwhile, the young Amakhosi reserves mentor Vela Khumalo, hopes his team will be able to build on from their last two wins. “We have never had it easy against Sundowns, they always gives us hard times. But with both teams having not been at their best this season this one could go either side.” Rest of the Diski Challenge fixtures: Saturday Maritzburg United v Orlando Pirates Marumo Gallants v Golden Arrows Baroka FC v Cape Town City SuperSport United v Swallows FC Stellenbosch FC v Chippa United Sunday Royal AM v TS Galaxy Sekhukhune United v AmaZulu FC Mamelodi Sundowns v Kaizer Chiefs
