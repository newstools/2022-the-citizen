France coach Fabien Galthie said Thursday his players had learned from their past disappointments as they prepare to face England on Saturday hoping to win their first Six Nations title since 2010. The French have recalled star winger Damian Penaud to the starting lineup as they go in search of a title that has eluded them for 12 years, and also try to achieve a Grand Slam. Penaud, who has scored three tries in this year’s tournament, was forced to sit out the 13-9 win against Wales in Cardiff last Friday after he contracted Covid-19. Galthie said he believed his team was ready for the pressure under the Stade de France floodlights.

But Ibanez, who spent six years playing in England, said England would treat the match as a World Cup final. “There is no lack of passion… all their matches to them are important and it is that that makes them strong, tough to the point of backbreakingly so, and redoubtable.” France team Melvyn Jaminet, Damian Penaud, Gael Fickou, Jonathan Danty, Gabin Villiere, Romain Ntamack, Antoine Dupont (capt), Anthony Jelonch, Gregory Alldritt, Francois Cros, Paul Willemse, Cameron Woki, Uini Atonio, Julien Marchand, Cyril Baille Bench: Peato Mauvaka, Jean-Baptiste Gros, Mohamed Haouas, Donavan Taofifenua, Thibaud Flament, Dylan Cretin, Maxime Lucu, Thomas Ramos
