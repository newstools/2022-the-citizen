What is the first thing you do after waking up in the morning?   For many people it’s getting the kettle on boil and having that proverbial first cup of coffee and maybe another cup thereafter and many more cups later in the day. For many South Africans, coffee is the immune booster, the start to a great day and there is nothing like a coffee break when you have so much on your plate. So, are you feeling guilty about that second cup of coffee?  Well Don’t. Studies have shown that indulging in your coffee craving can be good for your health when done in moderation. Thokozane Radebe, brand manager for Douwe Egberts said now there is no reason for you to say no to that second, or even third cup of coffee. “Own your coffee craving by knowing you are doing something good for your body.” Nutrition experts from John Hopkins University School of Medicine acknowledge that coffee contains antioxidants and other active substances that may reduce internal inflammation and protect against certain diseases. Fran Hu, a representative of the Nutrition Department at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health noted that two to five cups of coffee a day can be linked to a lower likelihood of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, liver and endometrial cancers, Parkinson’s disease and depression. According to the experts, some of the health benefits associated with drinking coffee include: Radebe said enjoying a cup of coffee is the morning ‘ritual’ for many who can’t start the day without it. “Various studies have shown that when indulging in your favourite coffee blend, you are doing your health some good.
