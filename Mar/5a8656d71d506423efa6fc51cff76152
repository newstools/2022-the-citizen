Weather forecasters expect some of the heavy downpours experienced across South Africa this week to clear up over the long weekend but warn more wet and windy conditions are brewing.  Associate professor in meteorology at the University of Pretoria Liesl Dyson said the recent conditions were due to tropical moisture moving over the country.  “In the past week or so, a tropical weather system called an Africane was situated over southern Angola and Mozambique,” she said.  Dyson said an Africane was a large-scale, hurricane-like low that occurred over the southern subcontinent of Africa and supplied ample moisture for rainfall in South Africa. She also said that in the past few days, a cold front had passed over the southern parts of the country.  “The combination of the two systems caused the heavy rainfall,” she said.

Tshwane Emergency Management Service spokesperson Charles Mabaso said no flood incidents had been reported in the metro as of yesterday.
