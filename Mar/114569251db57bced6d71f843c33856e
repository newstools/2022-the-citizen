Greyville Turf Best Bet: Race 4: Swinger – The Green Gallant (2) and Blazinglight (8) This rally does look like a two-horse race as the balance of the field is very moderate. In fact, the third favourite, Grey Linngari, is a five-year-old maiden who will be turning six in a few months. Value Bet: Race 5: National Flag (9) – eachway Trained by Paul Lafferty, this three-year-old was gelded in January and since then has improved remarkably. He won his maiden two runs back and followed that up with a decent third behind a very in-form Querari’s Cowboy on the Polytrack. Back on the turf he should be even better and is amazingly easy to back at 16-1.
