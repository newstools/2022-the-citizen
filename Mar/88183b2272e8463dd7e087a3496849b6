Trainer Lucky Houdalakis is enjoying a run of form and is particularly effective on his home course at the Vaal. So, we can expect the salt-of-the-earth character to be in the thick of the action when racing returns to the riverside main course on Thursday. His best chance comes in the ninth and last race of the day, when he saddles speedy filly What A Honey, who has a course and distance (1200m) win and a third to her credit from five outings to date. The three-year-old has been tried over a bit further since those efforts but might have been slightly stretched at this stage of her development and the drop back to her comfort zone is a logical move. Houdalakis might also fancy his luck with Miss Elegance (Race 6) and Brooklyn Bridge and English Primrose (both Race 8), but it’s Money Fighter in the fifth who is most likely to deliver a knockout. This willing and honest slugger has deserved more than his two wins from 17 bouts and could get in a decisive punch against modest opposition.
