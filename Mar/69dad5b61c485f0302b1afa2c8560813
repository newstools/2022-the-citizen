Turffontein Best Bet: Race 5: Queraress (1) – win This is a two-year-old filly not only taking on the colts, but also giving them weight in a feature race. However, she is a tree-time winner from four races and has earned the weight. Trainer Paul Peter thinks very highly of her, and he is expecting the filly to win. Value Bet: Race 7 quartet: Double float – Second Base (3) and Shangani (9) with the field. This is an interesting race because the best handicapped runners are not necessarily the best. However, they do have chances and almost any of them could run into the money. The cost of this bet is R672, but one can take a percentage.
