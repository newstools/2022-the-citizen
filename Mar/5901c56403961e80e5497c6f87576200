BEST BET RACE 3 EXACTA: 1-CASTLETOWN WITH 4 INVINCIBLE WARRIOR AND 5 CAPTAIN OF GRIT. If form works out well, and it should, Castletown looks as close to a the proverbial “racing certainty” as you will find. The other two stand out as the horses to follow him home. This bet will cost R2. VALUE BET RACE 7 NO 14 SMORGASBORD – EACHWAY This Paul Peter-trained runner has always been highly rated by the stable but proved a difficult ride. He has improved with gelding and a return to sprint distances has also made a difference. Smorgasbord faces his toughest task in the Grade 2 Senor Santa Stakes today but he carries just 52kg, has a top jockey in Warren Kennedy, and is described by his trainer as a runner with “a good eachway chance”.
