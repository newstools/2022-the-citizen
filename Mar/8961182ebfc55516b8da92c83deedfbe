After receiving a message from Hlebeya saying he wanted to kill their son, the wife informed her father-in-law. The father-in-law and a neighbour reportedly went to the house to check on Hlebeya, but received no answer when they knocked on the door. After forcing the kitchen door open and searching the house, they found the child with stab wounds and Hlebeya hanging from the garage roof. In a series of videos that have since gone viral, Hlebeya accuses his wife of cheating, and said life had been difficult after losing his job. “We also received information that the wife was admitted to the hospital and is currently processing the incident”, Mohlala said. Both Hlebeya and the child have since been laid to rest.  A murder docket and an inquest have been opened, and the case is currently being investigated.
