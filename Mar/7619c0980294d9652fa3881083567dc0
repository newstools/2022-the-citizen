Vaal Best Bet: Race 7: Calibre Crest (13) Although going off at 40-1 on debut, Calibre Crest ran a superb race to finish fourth, beaten by 3.60 lengths by Another Thief. The time was very fast and two winners have come from that form line already. That last run was over 1200m and the move up to 1400m can only be in his favour. The only concern is being No 1 draw up the Vaal straight, and a lot will depend on how easily jockey Julius Mariba will be able to find the best going. But the opposition looks very moderate and that is in Calibre Crest’s favour. Value Bet:  Race 8: Orus Apollo (12) – eachway This is an interesting runner. He has been running against a lot stronger opposition but has lost his form. However, that has resulted in a drop in his merit rating which has been reduced to 58 for this race. He takes a massive drop in class and it is interesting that trainer Fabian Habib has engaged Muzi Yeni for the ride. At 16-1 this looks a most appetising bet.
