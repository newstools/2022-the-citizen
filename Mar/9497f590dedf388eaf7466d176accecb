The Proteas women recorded their fourth win in a row on Thursday morning to remain unbeaten in the tournament and put themselves on the verge of qualifying for the semifinals, with three pool matches still to be played.

Actually before we started training today we got to watch a bit of the finish of their game today,” said Proteas captain Temba Bavuma. “So it is quite motivational and inspiring. We have sent messages to the women’s team in support of their journey at the World Cup. So to see them get those positive results is massive,” Bavuma added. “It does motivate us as well. We revel in their success and we will be looking to follow suit in this series.” ALSO READ: ‘We will not undermine Bangladesh’: Proteas captain Bavuma The Proteas take on Bangladesh at SuperSport Park on Friday, at the Wanderers on Sunday and back at SuperSport Park next Wednesday, before moving on to a two-match Test series against the same opponents.
