The Cheetahs and the Bulls found themselves in the pound seats at the halfway stage of the Currie Cup, after wins over the Sharks and Lions respectively on Wednesday. The Cheetahs survived an impressive fight back from the Sharks to emerge with a solid 29-15 win at Kings Park in Durban, reaching the middle stages of the campaign unbeaten on 26 points after picking up six straight wins. The Bulls then kept the heat firmly on the Cheetahs with their fifth victory of the competition, a bonus-point 40-10 result against the Lions at Ellis Park.
