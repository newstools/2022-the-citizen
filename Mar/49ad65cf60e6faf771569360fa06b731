GREYVILLE TURF BEST BET RACE 8 NO 4 AL’S MY DADDY – WIN This horse takes a major drop in class after running fourth in his last feature race. All three of his wins have been at this course and he won his only race over the course and distance. He is well drawn at No 4 and has Anton Marcus up. VALUE BET RACE 6 QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT 3-PETRA AND 9-VIVID JET WITH THE FIELD Any of the nine runners could win this race but the pair with the best form on this course are Petra and Vivid Jet. On that basis we can float these two runners but one must include the field as anything can run into the money. The full bet will cost R504 but one can take a fractional bet and 10% will cost R50.40.
