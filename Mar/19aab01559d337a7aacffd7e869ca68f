Fairview Turf Best Bet: Race 5: Swinger – Sabina’s Prodigy (6) and French Declaration (8) These two runners are raiders from the Western Cape, from the Justin Snaith and Andre Nel yards respectively, and they stand out head and shoulders above the rest of the field. Sabina’s Dynasty has run twice at the course for two seconds, while French Declaration also placed but that was on the Polytrack. He will be a lot better on the turf. Value Bet: Race 4: Glacier Gold (6) eachway Glacier Gold represents the combination of jockey Greg Cheyne and trainer Alan Greeff and could be worth following after an excellent win last time. He takes a slight jump in class but should be up to the task, especially from No 2 draw.
