The SIU is the only anti-corruption agency in South Africa that can investigate and litigate on behalf of state institutions. The agency has made significant recoveries through marrying quality investigations with civil litigation. At least R1.8 billion has been recovered between April 2020-March 2021. While the investigating unit does not identify its own matters for investigation, it works on the information provided by whistleblowers through its hotline,  or directly from state institutions and direct contact with whistleblowers. In January, the SIU’s report into PPE corruption found that government officials and suppliers treated R145 billion worth of Covid-19 relief funds, as a ‘get rich quick scheme.’ The agency’s damning findings described ‘an unrelenting attack’ on the Covid-19 relief funds with ‘scant regard for the public interest.’ The SIU’s latest investigation will look into allegations of corruption and maladministration at the Department of Health in Limpopo.
