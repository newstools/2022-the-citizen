A couple has been convicted on Covid relief-related fraud worth millions of rands.  Treasure Moremi, 34, and her husband Moroko Moremi, 37, were found guilty of fraud by the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crime Court last week.  It is understood that from May to October 2020, the couple, who are directors of Denmeng Trading, defrauded the labour department of an amount of more than R10 million through a Covid Temporary Employment Relief Scheme (Ters) application.  The National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) Lumka Mahanjana said the couple submitted a claim of 553 employees, whereas only 22 people were employed by Denmeng Trading.  Mahanjana said the head of the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crime Unit, advocate Marshall Mokgatle, welcomed the conviction. The matter was postponed to 17 May for sentencing.  Meanwhile, the Vryburg Magistrate’s Court has withdrawn the case against Sibongile Dube, 35, after he was arrested on suspicion of smashing windows at the Vryburg Magistrate’s Court. Dube was charged with malicious property damage.
