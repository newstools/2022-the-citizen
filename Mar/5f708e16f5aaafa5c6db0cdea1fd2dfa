FAIRVIEW TURF BEST BET RACE 2 EXACTA 1-FOREST SPY AND 6-LIKEABLE On paper this Exacta looks a shoe-in. Forest Spy looks like a top-class performer who we will be seeing a lot of while Likeable looks next best on form. Unless there is a decent first-timer in the field, which, based on betting and trainer comments does not look to be the case, these two should finish first and second in that order. VALUE BET RACE 3 QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT 1-TARANTINO AND 3-LEGITIMATE WITH NOS 2, 3 AND 5 This is not a big field and the top two should fight it out. The full cost of the bet is R72 but again one can take a percentage for just R7.20 The other option is to take this bet as a Trifecta where the top two must finish in the first three and just one of the other three run into the placings. This will only cost R18.
