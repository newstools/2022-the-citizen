The Proteas are confident they can progress to the final for the first time, after qualifying for the semi-finals of the ICC Women’s World Cup on Thursday. While their match against the West Indies was washed out at the Basin Reserve in Wellington, the single point was enough to seal second place on the log with a pool game to spare.

As the only team to have beaten the Proteas so far in the competition, however, Australia could be awaiting South Africa in what would be a potentially epic final. “The last game (against Australia) was the first time in five years that we have played against them, so you can’t look too much at previous records and stuff,” Kapp said. “I believe if everyone rocks up on the day we will be a force to be reckoned with. So we shift our focus now to India and then the semi-finals, and hopefully we will play them (Australia) again in the final.”
