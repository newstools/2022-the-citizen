The Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Limpopo sentenced a fraudster to eight years in jail for using forged documents to secure a R451,000 car loan. The Hawks said 32-year-old Dumisane Jan Mbokodo applied for a vehicle finance loan online from First National Bank (FNB) through a Toyota dealership in Polokwane, Limpopo. The application was processed, approved and the vehicle was successfully delivered to Mbokodo in Mpumalanga. “The bank became suspicious when the accused failed to honour his first instalment and started to review his application.  ALSO READ: R160 million fraud: Father, son stole millions from investment company – Report “It was discovered that the accused used fraudulent documents to apply for vehicle finance loan,” said spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke.
