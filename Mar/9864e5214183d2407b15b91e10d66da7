Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has announced that President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday sent a letter informing her of his intention to suspend her in terms of section 194 (3) (a). According to Mkhwebane, the President’s letter comes after the Speaker of the National Assembly wrote a letter to Ramaphosa informing him of the NA’s decision to start the impeachment process against her. Mkhwebane claims the letter in question was not sent to her.  “On Thursday, the Public Protector received a letter from the President confirming the news reports and informing her that he is considering suspending her in terms on section 194 (3) (a),” Mkhwebane said in a statement.

Contrary to the prevailing narrative, all she has ever asked for is a fair section 194 process.” Mkhwebane said she will be consulting with her legal team for a way forward.
