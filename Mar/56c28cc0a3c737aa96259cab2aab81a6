Jordaan says the young Bafana squad need to play against the best teams in the world in order for them to grow, especially after having a promising start in the 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifiers, only to lose out to Ghana 1-0 in the last game. “These young boys have done well, remember they went 11 matches unbeaten, the Ghana match was a bit of a tail spin. But it’s a young team, therefore we must give them the best possible opposition in the early age so that their maturity and experience can be accelerated. You cannot get a better nation than France. Now we will see how they cope with the World Champions in their own backyard.”
