The big day is here! Good luck to the thousands of cyclists partaking in the 44th annual Cape Town Cycle Tour today. It’s quite an emotional day for many as the 2019 event had to be held virtually due to Covid-19 and nationwide lockdowns.  Even though Sunday is set to be wet and windy, we are sure it won’t dampen participants’ excitement. Join in the fun by tuning watching it live as it unfolds.  Several key roads will be closed for the day – find the schedule here.  The stream below will go live at 5:55am on Sunday 13 March. If you’re preparing for the big day, take note of all the important bits of information here.
