President Cyril Ramaphosa has on Wednesday officially recognised king-elect Prince Misuzulu Sinqobile Zulu as king of AmaZulu. This in terms of Section 8(3)(a) and (b) of the Traditional and Khoi-San Leadership Act, 2019.  The official recognition follows the passing of King Goodwill Zwelithini Zulu in March last year and the passing of the regent queen Mantfombi Dlamini a month later. In terms of the requirements of the Act, the Royal family identified Prince Misuzulu Singqobile Zulu as the person who qualifies in terms of customary law and customs to assume the position of king and applied to the President for his recognition, said the Presidency in a statement.  “As required by the Act, the recognition of the king-elect by the President follows consultations with the minister of cooperative and traditional affairs and the Premier of KwaZulu-Natal.” King Misuzulu’s official recognition comes after the Pietermaritzburg High Court last week gave the green light for his coronation as the new king of the Zulu nation. Judge Isaac Madondo dismissed with costs an application lodged by late Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini’s brother, Prince Mbonisi Zulu, to stop the coronation from going ahead, after ruling that Prince Misuzulu was the “undisputed successor to the throne”.

I join all the people of South Africa in wishing His Majesty King Misuzulu Zulu a long and prosperous reign,” said Ramaphosa.  Additional reporting by Thapelo Lekabe
