The governing ANC continues to enjoy support in the rural Eastern Cape after it retained two wards in this week’s by-election. Voter turnout was low during by-elections that took place in the Eastern Cape’s Chris Hani region and Mpumalanga on Wednesday. In the Eastern Cape, ward 5 in Intsika Yethu and ward 1 in Engcobo in the Chris Hani district were left vacant after deaths of both ANC councillors Nolwazi Nyandana and Aphiwe Zihlangu respectively. The ANC amassed 91% or 1 098 votes in Wednesday’s by-election from a 34.76% voter turnout.  The EFF was second with just over 5%, followed by the UDM at 1.75%. In Engcobo, 94.79 % of the votes went to the ANC.

The results showed the overwhelming support for the ANC in the rural areas of the vast province, despite its declining voter support in other provinces. Mpumalanga’s by-elections took place in Pixley Ka Seme and Thaba Chweu municipalities. The ANC, ACDP, EFF and AUM contested ward 6 in Thaba Chweu, previously held by ANC’s councillor who resigned.
