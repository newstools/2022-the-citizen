Best Bet: Race 8: Swinger: Zanetto (1) x Camora (7). Zanetto is a very lightly raced four-year-old filly from the Highveld, having had only three outings. It seems she’s being prepped for the KZN Season. Trainer Paul Peter is again testing her against the boys, so he must hold her in high regard. Camora has done his best work over today’s course and distance. Value Bet: Pick3: Races 1-3. Leg 1: Ndaka (3) Leg 2: Nkalanzinzi (3) Leg 3: Thunder Masala (3)
