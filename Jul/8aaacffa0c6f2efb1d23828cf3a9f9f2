Testicular tumours were shoved into the spotlight earlier this week, after professional footballer, Sébastien Haller’s club confirmed that the striker had to leave the Dortmund training camp after he was diagnosed with a testicular tumour. The 28-year-old underwent a number of medical examinations on Monday, after complaining about feeling unwell during a training camp in Switzerland. According to CNN, Haller has since returned to Germany where he will undergo more medical tests. While most testicular lumps are benign, and often caused by something other than testicular cancer, it’s not something that should be brushed aside. According to Cancer Association of South Africa (CANSA), the number of men being diagnosed with late-stage cancer is on the rise. While testicular cancer is relatively rare globally, compared to other types of cancer, it accounts for about half of all cancers in men, and is one of the most common male cancers in South African men between the ages of 15 and 49.

Lumps, swelling and pain are more often caused by injury, infection or something else. Unfortunately, testicular cancer cannot be prevented, but guys can regularly check their testicles for any lumps, as symptoms don’t always present until the cancer has spread.

Contact your doctor immediately if you notice any swelling, lumps, changes in the size of your testicles or colour of your scrotum, or if you experience any pain or achy areas in your groin.
