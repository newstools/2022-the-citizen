SuperSport CEO Stan Matthews added: ”Gavin has a great history with our club and his coaching record speaks for itself with four PSL League titles and domestic cups to his name. “We have some fantastic young talent in the club that will benefit from Gavin’s vast experience and coaching ability and we look forward to him blending our youth with the experienced players we already have and the couple of new players who will be joining us in the weeks ahead. Hunt also won a Premiership title with Bidvest Wits, who he joined after leaving SuperSport but his career had tailed off a little in recent years, with ignominious spells at Chippa United and Kaizer Chiefs.
