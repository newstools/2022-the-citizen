South African rapper and television personality, Nadia Nakai released a new single on Friday, and so far, fans can’t get enough of it. Not The Same, a collaboration between Nadia and Lucasraps, is a traditional hip-hop flex lay with residual tinges of pop. Warner Music described the single as ‘a diss song at its core’ in a statement, adding that the single is void of maliciousness or a specific target as Nakai maintains that she fashions and operates in her own lane. “Nadia and Lucas’s hyper-focus on boasting about their economic power is presented through the mechanisms of name-dropping luxury brands and exposing the state of her bank balance. A track articulating Nakai’s essence as something which cannot be replicated and most certainly as something which cannot be compared, Not The Same is Nadia’s affirmation that this lane is hers and hers alone,” read the statement.

Speaking to Drumin January, Nakai said it’s a normal trajectory for an artist to eventually stand on your own two feet and figure out things on your own. “I felt like it was time I have learned so much information being at Family Tree. I have learned the whole business from the label, and I get to implement all that I have learned,” she told the publication at the time. *Compiled by Xanet Scheepers
