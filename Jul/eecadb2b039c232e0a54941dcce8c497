These matches will complete what will be a challenging international season for the Springboks which already features the current series against Wales and the Rugby Championship. “Our traditional year-end tour is taking shape, and the fact that we have confirmed one of the SA Select XV games already is great news,” said Springbok coach Jacques Nienaber. “The SA Select XV games will provide us with a chance to cast our net wider, build squad depth and give players as much game time as possible as the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France draws nearer. “We only have a limited number of matches left before we kick off our Rugby World Cup campaign in September next year, and we need to use every opportunity we can to give the players game time to develop our player combinations and build squad depth.” Saturday, 5 November – South Africa vs Ireland (Dublin – Aviva Stadium) Saturday, 12 November – South Africa v France (Marseille – Stade Vélodrome) Thursday, 17 November – SA Select XV v Bristol Bears (Bristol – Ashton Gate) Saturday, 19 November – South Africa v Italy (venue TBC) Saturday, 26 November – South Africa v England (London – Twickenham)
