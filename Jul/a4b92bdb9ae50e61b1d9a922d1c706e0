People planning to enter or leave the Kruger National Park were on Thursday warned about protests occurring around the tourist attraction. South African National Parks (SANParks) spokesperson Ike Phaahla said the Paul Kruger, Kobeni and Numbi Gates were affected on Thursday. He added that the Crocodile Bridge and Malelane gates were still open. The protest action started in Mpumalanga on Wednesday and continued on Thursday, even spreading to parts of KwaZulu-Natal. Bricks and burning tyres were used to block roads. The shutdowns come exactly a year after former president Jacob Zuma was sent to prison. His incarceration led to widespread unrest and looting in parts of KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. On Thursday, people took to the streets of parts of Mpumalanga, including Mbombela and Hazyview, to protest against the high price of petrol.
