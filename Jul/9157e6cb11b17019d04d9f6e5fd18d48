Following the spate of shootings in the taxi industry in the Harry Gwala and Ugu District, police Minister Bheki Cele and acting KZN transport MEC Jomo Sibiya visited Gamalakhe to engage industry role players on Thursday. The consultative meeting comes off the back of a spate of taxi related violence, during which taxi owners, drivers and members of the taxi industry leadership and the public have been injured and some killed. Long and short-term measures undertaken by the SAPS to address taxi industry safety concerns in the district were put in place. Sibiya appealed to the role players in the industry to be led by their conscience when taking decisions on matters where differences exist. He said there were various ways of improving the lives of all those who are involved in the industry without endangering their lives and those of the commuters. I hope that from today we are starting a new journey, a journey of peace where our people will board our taxis with easy hearts and with no fear of possible attacks on the taxis. Minister Cele said he will send a special team to investigate the killings in the industry in the area. “We are tired of the blood bath and this has to be brought to the table and be discussed. We are pulling a team that will assess the industry. “You will work with us and if you don’t SARS will know how you got rich. We will know how you generated your wealth and police officers who have a hand in this violence will be arrested,” said Cele.
