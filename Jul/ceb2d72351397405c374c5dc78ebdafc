The 26 year old Conco will add to the attacking options for Coach Maduka with his ability to play on both wings, whilst Monamodi who previously worked with the Head Coach at Royal AM brings depth into the defensive department for the Team of Choice,” the club confirmed. “After catching the attention of the Team of Choice with his consistent performances in the NFD for Uthongathi, Hlongwa also comes in to beef up the defensive unit.” Maduka will be hoping that his squad gives him what he wants when they play in the KwaZulu-Natal Premiers Cup at the end of July.
