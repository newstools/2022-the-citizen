The second season of the United Rugby Championship (URC) is set to kick-off in 50 days’ time with the league ready to build on an enormously successful first campaign that saw the Stormers claim the inaugural title. All 18 rounds are confirmed with broadcast selections and kick-off times to be confirmed in early August. The competition will kick off on the 16th of September, but the South African teams will not be in action until the following weekend, with the regular season then coming to an end in Round 18 on the 23rd April next year.

The Sharks and Lions will however face a tricky start to their campaigns with three rounds overseas before playing their first home game. The first seven rounds of the URC are set to be battled out before the competition takes a break for the Autumn Nations Series. Two rounds will then follow in late November and early December before another break sees the start of the Champions Cup and EPCR Challenge Cup start. The URC format will see all 16 teams ranked across a single table which will reward the top eight teams with their places in the Final Eight (quarter-finals), followed by a Final Four (semi-finals) to set the stage for the Grand Final. “The diversity of our league we so proudly celebrate, is also a reason for the immense complexity of putting together our season two fixtures. This is a monumental task, and it takes many stakeholders many long hours dedicated to making this the best club rugby championship in the world,” said URC CEO Martin Anayi. “We have to consider a variety of factors across our 16 clubs and five territories, but we believe that our season schedule will give our fans the best rugby week in and week out. My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has worked tirelessly to put together a blockbuster fixture list right from round one. “We have seen the success of our tournament format culminating in the grandest of Grand Finals last season and we look forward to going on this journey with our fans and with our stakeholders to another successful year of world-class rugby in action.” United Rugby
