In a statement on Thursday, the KZNLA said it had conducted an internal investigation that found that the Samkelisiwe tavern breached the “security commitments” of its license agreement. “The KZN Liquor Authority found that security commitments made by the licensee were not adhered to as per the application documents submitted, this resulted in the breach of the licence conditions set out by the Authority,” the organisation said. According to the KZNLA, the tavern’s license has been suspended for period of three months “or until such time that a security plan that was submitted is fully implemented and the KZNLA is fully satisfied with the same.” “The premises shall remain closed from 14 July 2022 until the end of the period of suspension thereof.”  Two suspects were initially arrested in connection with the shooting incident at the tavern, but were later released due to a lack of evidence.
