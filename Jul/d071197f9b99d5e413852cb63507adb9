You can see that some guys are very desperate to sign the contract because now they don’t have jobs after being released by their teams. I have seen a lot of familiar faces there and to tell you the truth, many won’t make it,” said the source. “There are also some guys who have been identified from the lower leagues and those guys are very hungry. They want to play in the PSL and they show it, they are giving their all. But the problem is that they lack experience and many of them are young. So, it becomes a problem for the technical team to select them. Even some of the reserve team players are showing good signs, but still, they are not exposed to playing at a higher level. I don’t know how it is going to unfold because time is not really on their side.”
