Banyana had other chances to score, especially when Noxolo Cesane fired over in the second half, but Tunisia threatened little themselves and in the end, they were able to celebrate as they sealed their passage to Australia and New Zealand in 2023.  Banyana, five time WAFCON runners up, can now focus on trying to win the competition for the first time. They will play Southern African rivals Zambia in the semifinals on Monday and if they come through that, will take on Nigeria or Morocco in the final on July 23.
