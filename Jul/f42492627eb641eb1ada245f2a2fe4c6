The Hawks seized counterfeit car parts worth R150 000 during a raid at two Gauteng businesses in Kempton Park and Midrand. Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Philani Nkwalase said the raid followed a meticulous investigation into the allegations of dealing in counterfeit vehicle parts.  The fake parts were passed off as genuine Ford and Volkswagen products. “A test purchase of the products to secure successful search warrants for each of the business premises, was executed.  Furthermore,  during the search, large quantities of vehicle parts and accessories bearing the Ford brand and logo were found from each of the two business premises. “The goods worth a combined value of R150, 000 were seized and transported to the designated counterfeit goods depot pending the finalisation of the criminal and civil cases against the suspects,” Nkwalase said.
