Season 18 of Idols SA has finally kicked off, and viewers got the chance to witness the very first auditions that took place on Sunday evening, in the search to find the next South African Idol. The judging panel for this season received a complete makeover as two former Idols SA judges, Unathi Nkayi and Randall Abrahams, were replaced by Gomora’s Thembi Seete, and creative entrepreneur and musician, JR. A familiar and loved face, which made a comeback onto the singing competition show is Somizi Mhlongo, who did not hold back on being his extra self and entertaining viewers, contestants, as well as the other judges throughout the episode.
