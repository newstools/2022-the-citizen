The Springbok forwards are expected to put in the hard yards and give the backline front foot ball to play off during the final Test against Wales at the Cape Town Stadium on Saturday, according to wing Cheslin Kolbe. Kolbe believes that the backline will be able to have their moment to shine if the grunt work can get done up front, which will then give them a chance to shine.

Wales and the Springboks do play a similar brand of rugby. “I have played against (Welsh wings) Josh Adams and Louis (Rees-Zammit) quite a few times at club level and they are amazing players with a lot of experience. So it is a good challenge to come up against them again and I am looking forward to that.”
