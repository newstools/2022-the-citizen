Over the past eight years I was able to live that dream and I feel I have given everything I could to the Proteas,” Lee said. “I feel that I am ready for the next phase in my career and will continue to play domestic T20 cricket around the world.” The 30-year-old made her international debut for South Africa in 2013 during the inbound tour against Bangladesh. In the 50-over game, the opening batter went on to amass 3 315 runs in 100 matches, including 23 half-centuries and three centuries with a career-best score of 132 not out against India in Lucknow in March last year. In the T20 format, Lee played 82 games in the green and gold, recording 1 896 runs, while notching up 13 fifties and one hundred against Thailand in 2020, which made her only the second South African woman to reach triple figures in T20Is.
