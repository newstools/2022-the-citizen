Start off your week with this delicious light steak and blue cheese salad by Chef Marcus Modimokwane.  Chef Marcus graduated from the acclaimed culinary school, Capsicum Culinary Studio in 2018. Since then, he has created a food company called The Flavour Studio that does catering, product development and brand collaborations.  He tries, by all means, to put forward the local cuisine scene on the map with a modern twist. Aware that South Africans love their meat, he has paired his steak with quick-cooking vegetables.  Noticing a trend of more salads, and less meat on our plates he adds that “traditional food is killing it in the formal restaurant business”, such as mala mogodu (cow or sheep insides), kota (bunny chow) and inyama yenhloko (cow head meat).  The chef paired his steak with blue cheese. The crumbly blue cheese provides a subtle flavour when paired with steak or sirloin.
