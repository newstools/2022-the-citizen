Since the July 2021 civil unrest, business owners no longer have confidence that their investments will be protected in KwaZulu-Natal.  That is the assessment of Palesa Phili, chief executive officer of the Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  “Are businesses confidence that their investments are safe and secure in KZN? The answer is no,” she said. “The majority of businesses don’t know what the plans are or what is happening from a security point of view,” she said. ALSO READ | Investigative hearing into the July unrest expected to begin on Monday Phili was speaking at an event in Durban organised by the KZN government on Friday to mark the one-year anniversary of the July 2021 unrest. About 257 people died in KZN, with thousands of shops damaged, torched and looted.  The unrest is estimated to have wiped R51 billion from the KZN economy. While the KZN government emphasised that a majority of businesses have since re-opened and investor confidence is back, Phili said that is not being reflected on the ground. Phili made an example of the House and Home Garden show that was held recently in Durban.  The feedback that we received was 40% of companies that were supposed to come, from outside of KZN, chose not to come because they feel that this is not a very safe province. However, Phili said there is consensus among KZN business owners to work to not let the KZN economy drop.
