When I interviewed all my coaches that came through, I was very clear. I do not want to change the style of play. “We’ve got speed, we’ve got endurance. When you go forward you close your eyes. I want to create an identity, which means I don’t want to change our style.” MaMkhize also announced that she had taken over the Celtic Ladies team but the details of the takeover are unclear at the moment but we will update them once they are available.  The club’s chief executive, Sinky Mnisi was meanwhile a notable absentee as the club announced the changes and their plans for the season ahead. As Phakaaathi’s Mgosi Squad broke the story earlier last week, Mnisi has been suspended by the club following a string of decisions that he allegedly took without the owners’ consent.
