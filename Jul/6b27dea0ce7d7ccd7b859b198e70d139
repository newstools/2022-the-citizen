Three school children were killed, and 13 others people were seriously injured, after the brakes on a mini bus taxi allegedly failed and it plowed into pedestrians in Inanda on Thursday afternoon. Prem Balram, spokesperson for Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), said they received a call for help from a frantic woman just before 3.30 pm. “The woman [said] she was a passenger in the taxi that overturned after it struck five pedestrians. “The only information she could provide regarding the location of the accident was that it was in the vicinity of a Shembe Church near Inanda Dam. She was severely injured and could not provide a pin drop to the location,” said Balram. On arrival, Balram said Rusa members and other paramedics, the Ethekwini Fire & Rescue Services and members of the South African Defence Force (SANDF) worked rapidly to stabilise 13 people who suffered severe injuries. He said three primary school pupils were killed. “One of the deceased was trapped under the wreckage of the overturned white Toyota Hiace. Firefighters utilised a high pressure lifting bag to elevate the taxi and remove the body of the child. “According to witnesses, the taxi was travelling down a steep road when its brakes failed. “The driver veered into an unpaved road when he struck five primary school pupils who were returning home. The minibus then crashed into a boundary wall before it overturned resulting in the passengers’ injuries.” Those who were injured were taken to hospital.
