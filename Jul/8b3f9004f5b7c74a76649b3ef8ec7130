South African DJ and business woman DJ Zinhle has had enough of the Twitterati’s constant running commentary about her relationship with rapper AKA. Zinhle and AKA have a 7-year-old daughter, Kairo Forbes together. The two have successfully been co-parenting their daughter, much to the dismay of tweeps as it would seem. A video of DJ Zinhle and AKA dancing ‘together’ at their daughter’s seventh birthday party sent the streets of social media into a frenzy with netizens suggesting that Zinhle is still in love with AKA and that her current partner and father to her baby daughter is just a rebound. DJ Zinhle gave birth to her and Murdah Bongz’s baby daughter, Santy in September last year.

Controversial celebrity Twitter blogger Musa Khawula didn’t let the opportunity to stir the pot pass him, posting a poll on his timeline asking tweeps to vote whether or not they think Zinhle is still in love with AKA. Do you think DJ Zinhle is still in love with AKA?— Musa Khawula (@MusaKhawula) July 9, 2022 Radio presenter and television personality, Anele Mdoda  took to Twitter to defend Zinhle and AKA’s relationship.  “The same people that dared to opine on Zinhle and AKA and how they choose to raise their daughter in an environment filled with love and no anxiety causing tension are the same ones that preach mental health and throw around buzz words like heal,” she tweeted.

For our baby mamas to be mature enough and put aside our differences as parents and allow us access to our children. Zinhle, women should learn from you. You have my respect.”  South Africans are really sad, @DJZinhle is doing what many of us wished and longed for most of our lives.

Nothing about yourself? Nothing you’ve achieved? All you can talk about is our shortfalls, what have tried? What have you achieved? At least we are brave enough to try..— #Siyabonga #ERAbyDJZinhle #ZeeNation (@DJZinhle) July 9, 2022 So basically, you can wait to see what I do tomorrow, cause that’s all you’ll have… Stay tuned!!!
