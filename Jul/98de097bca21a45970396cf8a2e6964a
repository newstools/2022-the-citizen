The Automobile Association (AA) has expressed support for the improving levels of safety in South Africa’s entry-level vehicles priced below R270 000. Based on the findings of 38 vehicles divided into three categories; Poor, Moderate and Acceptable, a total of 23 fell into secondary classification, with 11 obtaining an Acceptable rating and four a Poor rating. Despite the findings not taking into the account the structural integrity of the driver and passenger compartments, the AA stated that the awarding of between 20 and 50 points for the majority of vehicles tested “indicates that manufacturers are taking the presence of critical vehicle safety equipment seriously”. “The purpose of the research is to provide consumers with a starting point for vehicle purchases, be they new or second-hand,” the association said in a statement.

The inclusion of ESC, for instance, must be considered more seriously by manufacturers as this is proven technology which can reduce road crashes,” the AA said in reference to last year’s total road fatalities of 12 541 people. “We reiterate our call that this technology comes as standard for entry-level vehicles available in South Africa.” The full report can be viewed by clicking here.
