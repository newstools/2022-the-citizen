Eskom also released a schedule detailing what stage the power utility would be load shedding every day until Thursday next week, July 21. The power utility said it anticipates lower stages of load shedding to be implemented next week as some units return to service. Eskom said this will be confirmed closer to the time, or as major changes occur. “We currently have 4 501MW on planned maintenance, while another 16 320MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. As the generation capacity shortages persist over the next few weeks, load shedding will continue to be implemented at various stages. Eskom cautions the public that it will still take a few weeks for the power generation system to recover.
