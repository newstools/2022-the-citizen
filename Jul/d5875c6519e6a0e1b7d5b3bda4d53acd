Gareth Bale has recently signed for Los Angeles FC in the United States, after a final season at Real Madrid in which he might well have spent more time on the golf course than he did playing for Los Blancos.  ALSO READ: Chelsea closing in on deal for Sterling Bale’s love of golf was well-documented during an inconsistent spell at Real, where he certainly had his successes, but drifted out of the side in the final years of his contract, even spending a loan-spell at Tottenham in the English Premier League in the 2020/21 campaign.  Last season he was back at Madrid, however, and played only 290 minutes of football, not really enough time for much more than one round of golf.  In a study done by Sportingpedia, they have taken Bale’s huge salary at Madrid (about R10.6 million-a-week) and worked out that for the time he spent on the field last season, the Welshman earned about R1.9 million per minute that he was on the pitch.  According to the criteria of salary paid and playing time, Bale was far and away the highest earner across Europe’s top leagues last season, with his Real Madrid teammate Eden Hazard, who spent much of the campaign injured, coming in next at about R442 000.  Lionel Messi is far-and-away the best paid footballer in the world, salary-wise, earning an absolutely absurd R1.93 million a week at Paris St Germain. But the Argentine superstar did play 34 times for PSG last season, at about R350 000 a minute.
