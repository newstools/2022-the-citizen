We have always been open to any written offers for this great athlete. “Last week the player approached management requesting to play for a team closer to his home (Limpopo). “The president and the chairman together with the board members of Royal AM agreed to his request. “Subsequent to this discussion, Sekhukhune United wrote us a letter enquiring about the services of Letsoalo, and later submitted a written offer which the club accepted.” “ Facts: The media rumours that Kaizer Chiefs or any other team in the Premiership were pursuing the Bafana Bafana striker with a price tag of R20-million are far from the truth. “We have a good working relationship with Kaizer Chiefs and all other clubs in the Premier Soccer League. Had we received any written offer(s) from any club we would have entertained it. “As a club, we are not going to stand, deny or stop any player that is requesting a move to another club that has submitted a written offer.”
