The African National Congress on Sunday said it would observe a week of mourning following the death of the party’s Acting Secretary General, Jessie Duarte.  Duarte will be laid to rest at 2pm on Sunday as per Muslim burial rites, and a memorial service will be held on Thursday, 21 July 2022. The ANC said it “will be a short service, probably an hour”. Only two speakers will be appointed at the burial – a family member, and the party’s Paul Mashatile.  Mashatile said: “In that hour, we must also accommodate the Muslim rites which will be performed. My speech as the treasures general will also cover the alliance. We will not have speakers from the alliance”.
