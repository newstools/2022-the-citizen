BEST BET RACE 1 – SWINGER 1-ABSOLUTE PLEASURE AND 4 LADY CHARTOUCHE Candice Bass-Robinson has brought Absolute Pleasure from Cape Town for this race and she is the runner to beat. However, there is talk that Alan Greeff-trained first-timer Lady Chartouche is very decent but she could be a little green in her debut run. As a result, the Swinger looks the safe bet but one can also take Exactas with the pair. VALUE BET RACE 2 NO 2 VERIFIED- EACHWAY Gavin Smith has had a fantastic season and is in fifth place on the national trainers’ list this season. This three-year-old gelding tried the Polytrack last time but got caught wide on the turn over 1000m and finished 5.20 lengths behind the winner. He returns to the turf track and goes 1400m this time.  JP van der Merwe retains the ride and he looks good value in this field at odds of 10-1. Also take Swingers with No 5 Global Beat.
