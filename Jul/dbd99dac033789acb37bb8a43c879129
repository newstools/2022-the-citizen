Springbok hooker Bongi Mbonambi has finally paid up the outstanding money in a maintenance lawsuit that had the Sharks rugby player in hot water. The Bok star, who now plays for the Durban-based Sharks and also won the World Cup in 2019, apparently dodged paying maintenance for several years, according to The South African. Mbonambi paid over the outstanding money on Tuesday, after the Springs Magistrates’ Court attached his assets.

Mbonambi is currently in camp with the Springboks ahead of the start of the Rugby Championship. The Boks are scheduled to face the All Blacks in back-to-back Tests in Mbombela and Johannesburg on 6 and 13 August.
