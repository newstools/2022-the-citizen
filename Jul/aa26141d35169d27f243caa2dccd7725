But Chiefs have an advantage because they want to sign him straight out while Simba wants him on loan.  He also revealed that while Al Ahly are aware of the interest that some South African teams have in Percy Tau, they are unlikely to get him.  “The new coach has said that he knows Tau and is interested in keeping him in the team. But he is due to sit him down and they can discuss if he wants to stay or to be set free,” said the source.  Tau is believed to be unsettled at Al Ahly since Pitso left and the supporters are not making it any easier for him. He has been targeted for criticism every time the team does not do well.  Phakaaathi has also learnt that Orlando Pirates are the favourites to land him should he be released in Egypt. Cape Town City have also made their interest in the Bafana Bafana vice-captain known.
