Wayde van Niekerk kept his medal hopes alive with another convincing effort in the early hours of Thursday morning (SA time) as the world record holder booked his place in the men’s 400m final at the World Athletics Championships in Eugene. After struggling to bounce back from a serious knee injury, Van Niekerk showed a glimpse of his best form in the first-round heats earlier in the week. Returning to the track, he again had no trouble in his semifinal, taking second place in 44.75 seconds and progressing to the medal contest to be held on Saturday morning.
