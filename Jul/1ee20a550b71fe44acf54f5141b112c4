Johannesburg. Fourteen people have Sunday been killed during a shootout in a bar in South Africa's Soweto township, close to Johannesburg, police say. "We were called in the early hours of the morning, around 12.30am," said police lieutenant Elias Mawela after the shooting overnight Saturday and Sunday. "When we arrived on the scene, 12 people were confirmed dead," he said. Mawela said 11 others were taken to hospital with wounds but two later died, raising the toll to 14. The bar is in the Orlando district of Soweto, Johannesburg's largest township, southwest of the city.
