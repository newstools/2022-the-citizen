BEST BET RACE 8 NO 1 SPIRIT OF SILVANO – WIN This gelding is typical of the offspring of South Africa’s champion sire Silvano. Many of them show decent work early on but need time to mature. This looks the case with this Dean Kannemeyer-trained gelding, for whom the penny is just starting to drop. He looks worth a good bet and is a banker in all bets. VALUE BET RACE 4: QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT 4-ECHO OF LIFE AND 5-FUTURE GIRL WITH THE FIELD. The bookmakers seem to think that this is not an open race and although Echo Of Life is favourite, there are a number of runners who look to be improving. One of those is Future Girl who had a promising first run over 1200m and looks likely to appreciate the step-up to 1400m. Surprisingly, she is quoted at 10-1. The full Quartet will cost R864 but one can take 10% for R86.40 or even 1% for R8.70.
