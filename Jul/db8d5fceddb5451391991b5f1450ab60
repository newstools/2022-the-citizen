The tip led police to a house in Angincourt outside Bushbuckridge, upon arrival they found an elderly woman and the said vehicle. When initially questioned by the police, the woman denied having any knowledge of the vehicle parked behind her house but police kept pressing her for information. They went to search the vehicle and found that it was the VW Polo which was hijacked from Mashego. “Upon thoroughly checking the vehicle, members also discovered that the battery was removed and hidden inside the bedroom of the woman’s 46-year-old son,” added Mohlala.
