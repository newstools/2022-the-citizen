A new TikTok trend called the “fight challenge” has gone viral on social media proving that some kids will do anything for their parents.  This trend sees parents walking up to their children while they are either watching television or playing on their phones or tablets before urging them to put their shoes on.  The parent, who is also recording their child at the same time, then explains that they need their child to put their shoes on and follow them outside as they are about to engage in a physical fight. Not only does the parent explain that he or she will be fighting with another parent, but also requests for their child to get involved in the fight, and physically attack the other children of the parents who they will be fighting. Social media users all across the globe were shocked to see how many little ones would be willing to throw hands in and fight with other children their age all in the name of having their parents back and protecting their parents.
