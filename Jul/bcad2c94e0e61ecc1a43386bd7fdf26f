The collision occurred on D3260 towards Seloane. Seven people died at the scene and one succumbed to their injuries en route to the hospital. Other injured people were taken to Maphutha Malatji hospital in Namakgale. Speeding and reckless driving are cited as possible causes of the accident.

We have to, at all times obey and follow rules to the latter.  “It’s the only way to arrive alive and save lives” said MEC Boshielo. Issued by the Department of Transport and Community Safety
