Chief regent, Samson Buthelezi, was gunned down at his Nquthu home on Wednesday morning. This was confirmed by Sipho Hlomuka, MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. Through a statement, Hlomuka said Buthelezi was attacked by unknown gunmen who fatally shot him at his home in northern KwaZulu-Natal. “Buthelezi was designated as Iso lesilo (eye of the Zulu King) in the Jama Traditional Community in Nquthu and served with diligence and commitment,” said Hlomuka ALSO READ: Inkandla interim chief shot and killed “We wish to convey our condolences to His Majesty the King Misuzulu kaZwelithini and Indlunkulu for the loss of a faithful steward, who conducted the affairs of isizwe in a dignified manner.” Buthelezi’s death is the latest murder of traditional leaders, something that has become a serious problem for the KZN government. “His senseless murder leaves a gaping hole within the institution of traditional leadership within our province,” said Hlomuka. Hlomuka called on communities to assist the police in capturing the people behind the killings of traditional leaders.

Without the support of communities, law enforcement can only do so much,” he said. “We, therefore, plead with our communities to come forward with information that will assist law enforcement agencies to apprehend the cowards that are responsible for this act.” Hlomuka said senior officials have been dispatched to Buthelezi’s home to offer support for his family.
