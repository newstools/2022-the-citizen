Big betting pools and payouts are on the cards at Saturday’s Hollywoodbets Durban July race meeting at Greyville. Top of the wagering menu is an expected R12-million Pick 6 pool. The most popular exotic bet gets a R2-million carryover kickstart. Given the heightened excitement surrounding the 2022 July – the first in three years with spectators allowed onto the racecourse – the predicted pool could climb even higher. There appears to be a nailed-on Pick 6 banker in Race 8, the Grade 1 Garden Province Stakes, in the form of super mare Captain’s Ransom – making the choosing of six consecutive winners a tad easier. If she fails to arrive, the bet will pay the proverbial bombs. Another tempting July day morsel is a forecast R10-million pool for the Quartet bet on the July itself (Race 7 on the card) – again bolstered by a R2-million carryover. With the big race looking unusually competitive, with the favourites hovering around relatively long odds of 4-1 and 5-1, and many potential winners at longish odds, this Quartet looks set to pay a goodly sum to the lucky winners. An array of other bet types is on offer, including no fewer than three Jackpots (starting from as early as Race 1), with expected pools of R400,000, R1.5-million and R600,000. There are two Bipots, while the ever-popular Place Accumulator, starting in Race 3, will have R1.7-million to divide among those who can crack the elusive combo. A R100,000 carryover to the final Pick 3 of the day could see R500,000 amassed. All the usual tote bets are available on TAB: Win, Place, Swinger, Exacta, Trifecta, Quartet and rolling Doubles. Online bookmakers have a dizzying array of further options, such as north versus south winning trainer, best-placed Snaith runner, first three-year-old past the post, jockey doubles on the day and top three in the current betting versus the rest of the field (the “field” was edging in on Friday, giving an indication of how wide-open a contest it is). 4-1 Safe Passage 5-1 Linebacker 7-1 Pomp And Power 9-1 Aragosta 12-1 Sparkling Water, Do It Again, Hoedspruit 15-1 Kommetdieding 20-1 Jet Dark 25-1 Waterberry Lane 30-1 Belgarion 35-1 Al Muthana, Airways Law 45-1 Flying Carpet 75-1 Red Saxon, Second Base 90-1 Puerto Manzano 100-1 Astrix
