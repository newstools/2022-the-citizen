Media personality and choreographer, Somizi Mhlongo, has once again shared one of his favourite dishes to make using the same ingredients which he has been cooking and eating all week, just in a more fun and exciting way.  Taking to Instagram, the Idols SA judge posted a short tutorial on how he creates his quick and delicious breakfast pizza. Although he did not share the exact measurements and instructions on how to create the dish, we have shared a delicious and easy-to-make breakfast pizza recipe that is very close to the breakfast pizza that Somizi shared on his Instagram feed.   To create Mhlongo’s exact breakfast pizza, just add some fried scrambled eggs, a few teaspoons of cream cheese, some fried slices of russian sausage (instead of bacon) and a few teaspoons of your favourite atchar.
