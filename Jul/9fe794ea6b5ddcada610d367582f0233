ALSO WATCH: “While the State was ready to proceed with the trial, attorneys for some of the accused persons advised the court that they were not placed in funds by their clients to secure their services for the duration of the trial. “For this reason, the pre-trial conference will be held in chambers with the accused not needing to be in court,” Ramkisson-Kara said. She said the accused must return to court on 1 August, when it is anticipated that the issues of funds will be resolved and the matter can proceed thereafter. Gumede and others face several charges including conspiracy to commit corruption, corruption, fraud, money laundering, and contravention of the Municipal Finance Management Act. The State alleges that eThekwini officials, including the city manager and ex-mayor, circumvented the supply chain management (SCM) processes on a Durban Solid Waste (DSW) tender worth over R300 million, for the benefit of an identified service provider. Meanwhile several well-known ANC leaders in KwaZulu Natal (KZN) were also in court to support Gumede.
