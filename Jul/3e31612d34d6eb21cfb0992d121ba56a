With its flagship T9 still waiting in the wings after being confirmed for South Africa last year, Chinese automaker, JMC, has afforded a new petrol engine to its entry-level T6 bakkie. A model that has obtained moderate success since being launched four years ago, the T6 slots-in below the mid-range T8 and while until now diesel powered, gains a normally aspirated 2.0-litre unit that produces 108kW/190Nm. Like the diesel, whose 100kW/320Nm 1.9-litre oil-burner can trace its roots back to Volkswagen’s early rendition of said unit, the petrol is paired as standard to a five-speed manual gearbox with drive going to the rear wheels only. Claimed fuel consumption is ten-litres per 100km. Measuring 5 315mm in overall length with its wheelbase stretching 3 090mm, the T6 stands 1 815mm tall, has a width of 1 830mm, ground clearance of 190mm and according to JMC, a payload of 820kg as well as a braked trailer towing capacity of 2 000kg.
