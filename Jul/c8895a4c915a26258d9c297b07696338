A man convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend was executed in the southern US state of Alabama on Thursday despite objections from the victim’s family.

James had petitioned the US Supreme Court to stay his execution “pursuant to the wishes of the surviving members of the family of the victim”. “The victims and their families are paramount in our justice system, and deserve to be heard on the matter of the ultimate punishment of offenders,” James’s lawyer said in an appeal to the Supreme Court. Hall’s daughters, who were six and three years old when their mother was murdered, had said they wanted James’s life to be spared. “I don’t want it to go forward. We’re not God,” Terryln Hall told CBS 42. “An eye for an eye has never been a good outlook for life,” added her sister, Toni Hall.
