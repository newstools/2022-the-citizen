Plus we have a new coach Jose Riveiro, who I believe is bringing in a lot of positivity and good energy into the team. So, everybody is just hyped up and we all know how important it is for us to try and win trophies next season,” said the Namibian international. “The coach is very good and he seems to have everything organised. He knows what he wants and he has told us. So, slowly but surely we are getting there and another thing is that he is a simple guy who just wants the best for his players.” With the club in pre-season and with a lot of changes at Pirates, Hotto says the new members of the squad have fitted in very well at the club and they are showing hunger for succes.  “You know, in football players come and go. Yes, we have lost a number of players in the team, but we move on. Such things happen in football. We just have to look forward to the new season and welcome the new guys at the club. I’m just happy that they are adapting really well and they want to achieve big things with the club, that is the most important thing,” he added. “We have to be focused and challenge for everything for everything that will be on offer. “Everyone is showing some good signs in pre-season and we are all working hard to make sure when the season starts we are all ready for the challenge.”
