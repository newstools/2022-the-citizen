The Presidency and King Misuzulu will let the legal processes respond to the new interdict by those in the royal family who are against recognising the Zulu leader as king.  The faction, led by Prince Mbonisi Bekithemba KaBhekuzulu, filed an urgent application with the Pretoria high court seeking the court to set aside the recognition of King Misuzulu kaZwelithini. They are also interdicting the Presidency, National Department of Cogta and the KZN Premier, Sihle Zikalala, from providing any financial and administrative support to Misuzulu’s office.  In the papers, which The Witness saw last week, the group wants the court to declare Misuzulu not the lawfully appointed king of the Zulu Kingdom, and also want the coronation committee disbanded. The 78-page application, with 12 other royal family members in support and filed last week, also asked the court to accede to Prince Mbonisi’s request to have the matter dealt with on July 26.  Prince Mbonisi, who is the late King Goodwill Zwelithini’s brother, also wants the court to bar Prince Thulani Zulu from acting as the spokesperson of the royal family.

The court interdicts, counter-interdicts and the recent floods that left a trail of destruction in the province have all contributed to delaying the coronation of King Misuzulu. Presidencial spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said the Presidency was not aware of the court action.  “When it does reach the attention of the Presidency, we will not respond to it via the media, instead we will follow due process,” he said.  King Misuzulu’s spokesperson, Prince Thulani Zulu, said the royal family would not comment on the matter until it is resolved in court.
