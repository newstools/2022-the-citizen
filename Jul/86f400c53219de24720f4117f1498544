Horse trading at the ANC KwaZulu-Natal provincial conference on Friday afternoon intensified after it emerged that some of the key candidates have pulled out of the leadership race. There has been six candidates vying for the ANC provincial chairperson position. However, following the counting of the results of the ANC branch nomination process, some candidates are rumoured to have thrown in the towel. “They didn’t make the 25% branch thresh hold. “There is a chance though that they could try to get nominated by delegates at the conference,” a senior ANC member in the province said. The six ANC members who were tipped to contest the ANC provincial chairperson are Premier Sihle Zikalala – who is the incumbent, Finance MEC Nomusa Dube -Ncube, Community Safety MEC Peggy Nkonyeni, KZN Legislature Chair of Chairs Sibiniso Duma, businessman Sandile Zungu and former KZN director general Nhlanhla Ngidi. However, four of the six candidates received less than 25% of the votes during the branch general meeting (BGMs) which took place during the build up to the conference. This resulted in negotiation between camps as a faction attempt to consolidate their support ahead of the election process scheduled to get underway on Friday evening. By late Friday afternoon, the conference- which will take place at the Durban Convention Center, was due to kick off. High profile ANC members attending the gathering include tourism minister Lindiwe Sisulu and human settlement minister, Mmamoloko Khubhayi.
