Last week, the Kwazulu-Natal Liquor Authority (KZNLA) suspended the liquor license of the Samkelisiwe Tavern and Restaurant for a period of three months. The KZNLA said it had conducted an internal investigation that found that the tavern breached the “security commitments” of its license agreement. “The KZN Liquor Authority found that security commitments made by the licensee were not adhered to as per the application documents submitted, this resulted in the breach of the licence conditions set out by the authority,” the organisation said in a statement.
