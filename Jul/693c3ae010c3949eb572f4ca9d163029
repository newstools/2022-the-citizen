The planned massive, multimillion-rand national elective congress of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), set for Monday, remained in limbo on Friday.  This is after Johannesburg Labour Court Judge Graham Moshoana reserved judgment until this weekend – after hearing a marathon argument in the case brought by Numsa second deputy president Ruth Ntlokotse – challenging the constitutionality of her suspension, along with other shopstewards and elected leaders of South Africa’s largest trade union.  Numsa has been rocked by intense leadership infighting, sparked by the suspension of Ntlokotse and several other leaders, barred by the union’s central committee from attending the congress.

Meyerowitz said the central committee could suspend leaders: “The constitution provides for that.” Counsel Nhlapo said Ntlokotse’s suspension violated Numsa’s constitution. “Only the national executive committee is vested with the powers to discipline a national office bearer.” NOW READ: Numsa infighting threatens to spill over in umbrella Saftu
