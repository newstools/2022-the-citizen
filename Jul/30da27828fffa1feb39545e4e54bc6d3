BEST BET RACE 7 NO 9 COURAGEOUS CAT – WIN This Mike de Kock-trained runner could not have been more impressive when winning is maiden by 8.50 lengths. His victory set tongues wagging an everybody said tis colt would dominate the three-year-old Classics but he has not raced since that victory in October last year. The word, however, is hat his work is excellent and in a moderate field he should prove too good. VALUE BET RACE 8 NO 18 PUTIN’S PROMISE – EACH WAY There is a strange rule in local racing when it comes to the lower divisions that gives preference to horses who fall in the parameters of the merit rating of the race when it comes to getting into the final field. To explain, this race is a MR 68 Handicap so every runner with a net merit rating of 68 or less will get preference when getting into the race while those with a merit rating above that ceiling will only get direct entry to the field if final acceptances are below the maximum number. The best they can do is become reserve runners so will need a scratching in order to get into the race.
