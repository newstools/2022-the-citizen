BEST BET RACE 1 SWINGER: 4-READY TO FLY AND 3-LADY HEIST Both these horses have won over 1400m on the Polytrack, the distance of this race. Both horses have not finished outside the first three in their three runs, but Lady Heist has had winners coming out of his form lines. This should be close between the two of them so the Swinger is the safe bet. VALUE BET RACE 4 NO 6 SONJADOR – EACHWAY This is a race for apprentices and experience tells one that it is worth going for the best apprentice in these cases. In this case it is Rachel Venniker, who soon will be declared champion apprentice for the season, and she rides Sonjador for trainer Michael Roberts.   This gelding drops in class and at odds of 10-1, looks an appetising Win and Place opportunity.
