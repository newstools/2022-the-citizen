When it comes to creating world-class radio, DJ Sabby has nailed it down.  The Metro FM DJ hosts the station’s official Top 30, which has quickly become the station’s most-listened-to show with over 1.1 million listeners, and now he’s taking his unique approach to radio global as he teams up with New York City Power 105’s Nyla Symonee and London’s BBC 1Xtra presenter DJ Ace.  The idea to bring a global radio show to life came about after the trio connected through their passion for one-of-a-kind, modern-day broadcasting. They said they have always wanted to push boundaries when it comes to the content that they create.  Through technology, the world is smaller and people are more in sync with one another through the advancement of technology and social media. This inspired the OneLoveCrew radio show. The new segment sees the hosts link up to create content that will premiere across each of their respective radio shows.
