With recent reports suggesting Ford will be unveiling the all-new Mustang in the second quarter of next year, the Blue Oval has confirmed local availability of its most powerful Shelby fettled model ever, the GT500 KR. A first for South Africa, the KR, or King of the Road, will be limited to 225 examples worldwide, with four said to be heading to South Africa between next year and 2024.

Equipped with a new cooling system, upgraded 3.8-litre Whipple supercharger, a new intercooler and heat exchange system, the unit kicks-out a claimed 900 horsepower or 670 kW, an uptake of 104 kW over the standard GT500. Despite Ford not disclosing any performance figures, it did confirm a 14 kg weight reduction thanks to the inclusion of a vented carbon fibre bonnet, diffuser, splitter and Gurney flap, as well as the inclusion of stronger half-shafts, recalibrated MagneRide suspension, new front and rear sway bars, plus upgraded front and rear springs. Mounted on polished or gloss black 20-inch forged alloy wheels, the KR also sports a Borla exhaust system, optional dual racing strips and a 60th anniversary commemorative plaque to celebrate 60 years of the brand founded by the late Carroll Shelby. Inside, the KR tweaks are more subtle and comprise leather seats, Shelby embroidered floor mats, a Shelby builder’s plate and number in place of the Mustang item on the dashboard, and a Shelby approved certificate as well as entry into the official Shelby registrar. As mentioned, availability commences next year with pricing from R4.4-million.
