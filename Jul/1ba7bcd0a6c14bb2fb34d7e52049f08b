The Sindiso Magaqa murder trial at the Pietermaritzburg High Court was postponed to Tuesday after one of the suspects didn’t appear at the court. The fourth accused, Sibusiso Ncengwa, did not appear in court reportedly because of miscommunication regarding his transport from the Kokstad Correctional Services Facility to Pietermaritzburg. The trial was also postponed after the third accused, Mlungisi Ncalane, stated he intends to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Ncengwa and Ncalane, along with former police officer Sbonelo Myeza and businessman Mbulelo Mpofana, have been charged with the murder of Magaqa in 2017.
