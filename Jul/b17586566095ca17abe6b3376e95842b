A 35-year-old man, who jumped from the Howick Falls viewing platform at around 3pm yesterday afternoon, miraculously survived the fall.  According to an eyewitness, the man clambered over the metal barrier and jumped, somehow missing the rocky outcrops immediately below the platform. It is believed that the man’s fall was slowed and stopped by the many thick trees and bushes which line the gorge.  A quick-thinking municipal security officer immediately called for assistance and some bystanders made their way down to the valley floor to see if they could help.
