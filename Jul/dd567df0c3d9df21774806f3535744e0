So, today’s Wordle might have been a tad tricky and not everyone was able to keep their streak going. As is customary, Twitter is the place to blow off steam.  And Wordle has the Twitterverse divided into two groups today – those who believe it’s not a real word, and those laughing at everyone else.  One netizen said: “I really think Wordle has gotten harder over the past few weeks. I’m not complaining, because I like a bit of a challenge. Just observing; it definitely seems like a pattern.” How do people not know this word? Another player vented: “This is not even a real word! Nonsense. Wordle has lost the plot.”  If anybody is in a really good mood, try today’s wordle, that will change it. – Donald Pond. Do you need a hint?
