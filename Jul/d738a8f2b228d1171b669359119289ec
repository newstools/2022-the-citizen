Three alleged rhino poachers, aged between 23 and 49 were arrested in the Kruger National Park this weekend, but not before they had managed to kill at least four rhinos. According to police the poachers were caught thanks to a tourist, who reported gunshots in the park on Friday evening.

The suspects are expected to appear in the Bushbuckridge Magistrate’s Court on Monday morning on charges of possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, as well as charges related to poaching and illegally entering the park.  The men are allegedly all Mozambican citizens, and since they are in the country illegally, they face further charges of contravention of the Immigration Act.
