Introduced just over a year ago as its entry-level SUV/crossover, Kia has officially confirmed price and specification details of the turbocharged Sonet T-GDI. Previewed alongside the normally aspirated model at the local market launch in Cape Town last year in GT-Line guise, Kia has opted to forgo the sporty moniker in favour of the T-GDI designation. This means the Sonet does without the usual GT-Line exterior applique such as the model specific bumpers, extended doors sills and alloy wheels, but as indicated, receives a considerable power boost over the current models.

Drive once again goes to the front wheels but this time through a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox with no manual option. Dimensionally, the Sonet T-GDI is unchanged from its sibling, however, on the specification front, the entry-level LX has been overlooked with the EX being the entry point and the newly added EX+ the flagship. In terms of features, the EX comes as standard with 16-inch alloy wheels, an eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as: On top of these, the EX+ adds a 4.2-inch TFT instrument cluster display, red stitching on the seats, automatic climate control, folding electric mirrors, cruise control, a drive mode selector and a total of six airbags. As with the non-turbo versions, the Sonet T-GDI’s sticker price includes a five-year/unlimited km as well as a four-year/60 000 km service plan.
