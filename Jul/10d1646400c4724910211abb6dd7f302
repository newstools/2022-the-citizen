Barely hours after the tragic killing of patrons at a tavern at the Nomzamo informal settlement in Orlando, Soweto, a scuffle between members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and Operation Dudula broke out. It appears the scuffle was about who arrived at the crime scene first.  All this happened as the police were still busy with investigations in a bid to find out what could have led to the shooting.  The shooting took place at the Mdlalose tavern in the early hours of Sunday. The death toll has risen to 15.
