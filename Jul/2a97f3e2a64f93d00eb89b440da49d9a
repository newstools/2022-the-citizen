The design of the We Rise Again jersey is a tribute to the club’s bold commitment to go out and conquer once more.” Sundowns brand ambassador and club Legend, Teko Modise said: “The design on the jersey is a bold declaration of Mamelodi Sundowns’ intention to conquer in all battles they face this season. The debossed design elements will remind the players they are not alone in battle but are united with other warriors in the supporters and those who have played for the team. As footballers, we want to look stylish on-an-off the pitch. The texture of the jersey feels fresh, and the design is slick – I trust that this and the debossed symbols on the jersey will propel the players to the next level and continue to fight regardless of how tough it might be.”
