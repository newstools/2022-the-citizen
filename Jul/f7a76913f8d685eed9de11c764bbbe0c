It is very encouraging and that is what pushes us to win our games and play entertaining football,” said the Soweto born player.The fame  started earlier this year when Vilakazi was playing for Doornkop Students at the Philly’s Games in Tembisa, with his videos going viral on social media. “A lot of people don’t know this, but before the Philly’s games, I was already a Chiefs player. It is just that I joined the team at the end of the season. But, I am happy to be part of the team now and what I have to do now is to make sure that I work hard and improve as a player. Anyway, it’s been great to be part of this team and I really appreciate it and I am thankful for all the support I am getting.” With all the fame around him, Vilakazi has remained humble and he thanks his grandmother for teaching him how to carry himself as a person. “I was raised by my grandmother and that has helped me to be humble. She has taught me a lot of things about life and what is important to me right now is to make her proud,” he concluded.
