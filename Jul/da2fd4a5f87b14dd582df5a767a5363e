BEST BET RACE 1: SWINGER: 6-BOISTEROUS AND 9-LOVERS LANE This is a highly competitive card and nothing obvious stands out, but these two horses have good room for improvement and look the ones to beat. VALUE BET RACE 5: QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT 5-DARK TRAVEL AND 8-STUNNING KITTEN WITH THE FIELD This race is wide open and every one of the 11 runners has a winning chance. This Quartet will pay as both floating bankers and already at a good price. This will cost R864 for a full Quartet but one can always take percentages so 10% will cost R86.40.
