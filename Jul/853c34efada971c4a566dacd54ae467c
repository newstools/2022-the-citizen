On Wednesday, truckers and taxi drivers blocked off major roads leading to the Mbombela CBD, in what appears to be the beginning of a national shutdown.  Several roads are currently inaccessible to motorists, including Madiba Drive, the R40, the N4, and the D2269. Officials had been dispatched.  The protest is likely a result of rising petrol prices, the rising cost of living in South Africa and Eskom’s incessant rolling blackouts.  Back in June, several factions threatened a national shutdown. At the time, however, talk of country-wide protests eventually petered out.
