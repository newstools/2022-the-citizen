Most importantly, helping the team to qualify for the quarter-finals, so, we know how important it was for us to get out of the group and we had our objectives and managed to top our group. Now that is out of the way and we are looking forward to the quarter-finals,” said Smidt. “Like we did in the group stages, we are going to take it game by game and the focus is on the quarter-finals now and we know how important it is (for us to win).” Smith added that despite the injury to their star player Thembi Kgatlana the team is still in high spirits ahead of the Tunisia clash. “The mood in the camp hasn’t changed, the objective remains the same. Yes, we sympathise with the likes of Thembi, we know how important she is in the team. But she is a very strong minded person, for her, she didn’t want us to sympathise with her. She just wants us to continue with the objective.”
