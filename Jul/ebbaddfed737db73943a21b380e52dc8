Beauty content creator Mihlali Ndamase is once again the main point of discussion in the streets of social media after businessman Leeroy Sidambe shared a photo of the two of them looking very intimate on Instagram. There has been much speculation about the relationship status between Mihlali and Leeroy, especially as the businessman is still said to be married to Mary Jane Sdambe. Many publications and celebrity gossip websites have, however, reported in recent weeks that Leeroy and his wife are separated.

There are also rumours of Mary Jane having cheated on Leeroy for five years with a businessman while she was still married to him. None of these rumours have, however, been commented on by any of the parties involved. The Twitterati nearly lost their minds on Saturday evening when pictures of Mihlali and Leeroy sporting matching black and white outfits surfaced on social media. The picture of the two of them looking rather intimate about to share a kiss had Tweeps pondering whether Leeroy is still with his wife, as he was the one who shared the photo on his Instagram account first before Mihlali shared it on her Instagram stories. Many argued that sharing an intimate photo of you and your side-chick on social media while you are still married is the height of disrespect towards your wife.    While the new couple seems to have a lot of support in favour of their union, others are breathing fire at Mihlali, calling her a homewrecker and rubbing the relationship in Mary Jane’s face.
