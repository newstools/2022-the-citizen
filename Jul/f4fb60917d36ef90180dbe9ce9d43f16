The charm of the British is evidently working its magic on social media. On Twitter, fans don’t hesitate to share their love – and desire – for their favourite celebrities, not to mention members of the British royal family.  By analysing almost 115,000 tweets containing the words “hot,” “horny,” and “sexy,” a study determined the 10 members of the British royal family seen as the sexiest by users on the platform. Prince William leads the ranking with 1,204 tweets in total. His brother, Prince Harry comes third, with 1,126 tweets, slightly behind his wife, former actress Meghan Markle, with 1,196 tweets. The controversial pair, who left the United Kingdom for the United States, is the sexiest couple, with 2,322 tweets in common, compared to 2,005 tweets for the future King and Queen of England. Kate Middleton comes only seventh, far behind her sister-in-law, and is surpassed by Lady Amelia Windsor, the cousin of Princes Harry and William. Indeed, the 26-year-old is one of the most fashionable models of the moment. While Camilla Parker Bowles doesn’t make the ranking, her husband, Prince Charles, flies the flag for the family’s older members by taking tenth place in the list.  ALSO SEE: Royal news: Harry’s memoir unlikely to be released this year, George shares uncomfortable Wimbledon moment 1.
