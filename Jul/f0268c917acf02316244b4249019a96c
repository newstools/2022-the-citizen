The Diski Shield features the teams that finished in the Diski Challenge top eight last season. “Our matches against Orlando Pirates are always interesting and this one will be no different. It will be another humdinger,” the Sundowns reserves coach told SuperSport.com. “But we have prepared well, I believe we will be ready for whatever they will throw at us on Saturday. You know we have to beat the best to win this. If we can’t beat Pirates in the quarterfinal clearly we do not deserve to win it.” The young Brazilians are itching to lift the Shield silverware so much after the team came close two times before.
