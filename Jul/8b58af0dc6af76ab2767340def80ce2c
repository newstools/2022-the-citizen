Another of South Africa’s increasingly slim medal opportunities slipped away at the World Athletics Championships on Friday morning (SA time) as Luxolo Adams trailed home in eighth place in the men’s 200m final in Eugene. Competing on day seven of the track and field showpiece, Adams crossed the line in 20.47 seconds, well off the pace of Noah Lyles who clocked a lightning fast 19.31 to lead an American podium sweep. After enjoying a breakthrough season, Adams did well to reach the final, but SA fans would have been quietly hoping for him to spring a surprise.

With the national team having missed out on the podium at the 2019 World Championships in Doha and last year’s Tokyo Olympics, opportunities were again running out with three days of action left in Eugene.

Though she is facing a battle, 20-year-old Prudence Sekgodiso is hoping to keep her medal hopes alive in the women’s 800m semifinals on Saturday, after progressing beyond the heats on Friday. The national 4x400m relay teams will be eager to punch above their weight, along with Wayne Snyman (35km walk) and Marione Fourie (100m hurdles), in an attempt to get the SA team on the table.
