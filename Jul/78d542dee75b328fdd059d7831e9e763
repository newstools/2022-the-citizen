A Paarl family have been left devastated after their 9-year-old tragically lost his life in a freak accident on Friday. The boy fell off the back of a vehicle on a farm in the Lusignan area in Paarl, Western Cape, and landed with his head under the trailer tyre. Despite Drakenstein Farm Watch (DFW) Emergency medical volunteers’ prompt response, nothing could be done to save the child’s life. Upon arrival on the scene, the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and ER24 Ambulance staff confirmed the nine-year-old’s death. According to the DFW, the nine-year-old lost his balance and this is what caused him to land underneath the tyre of the trailer. Police will, however, investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragic death of the child. *Compiled by Xanet Scheepers ALSO READ: Petrol thieves running rampant, warns Fidelity security group
