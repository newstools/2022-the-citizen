Allan joins the Dube Birds from Tuks FC,” read a tweet from the club. Swallows have lost over 10 players, with some members of the squad from last campaign having come to an end on their loan spells, while some have returned to their teams following the expiry of their loan deals. The likes of George Matlou, Dillon Solomons and Kamohelo Mahlatsi have  joined Kaizer Chiefs, with the trio having been regulars at the team last term. Meanwhile, Orlando Pirates’ Austin Muwowo and Monnapule Saleng, as well as Katlego Mohamme and Grant Magerman from Mamelodi Sundowns saw their loan spells with swallows end. The club is said to have been busy conducting trials in their quest to rebuild the team in the last two weeks, with Mgosi Squad revealing that former Pirates defender Kwanda Mngonyama is part of the players who are trying to secure a job at Swallows. Allan is the first player to be announced by the club ahead of next season and the team is expected to make more announcements soon.
