A former ward 17 councillor in Msunduzi, Pietermaritzburg, is lucky to be alive after he survived an assassination attempt on Monday afternoon. Thamsanqa Sithole from Imbali Unit BB, whose term ended last year, was attacked by unknown men while he was driving on Willowfountain Road. He managed to drive away without sustaining any injuries during the attack. The incident happened at around 4 pm. Speaking to The Witness on Tuesday, he said he was driving back home after going to a car wash on Willowfountain Road. “Everything happened so fast. A number of men just came out of nowhere and started shooting at the car I was driving. “I managed to drive off without being injured but the car had a lot of bullet holes in it. I am just grateful to be alive,” he said. Sithole said he does not know why he was attacked. This is a developing story.
