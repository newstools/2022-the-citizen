What used to be one of the most seamless processes to obtain a visa to enter a foreign country is about to turn into a massive headache for South African tourists travelling to Turkey. Business Insiderreported on Friday that travel agencies are warning their customers that their e-visas to enter Turkey are not valid, even if they were issued online from 6 July 2022. The country who recently changed its name to Türkiye, have yet to release a statement explaining these new changes. Previously South Africans could apply for a visa online to enter Turkey at least 48 hours before their flight departed after which it would be emailed to you.
