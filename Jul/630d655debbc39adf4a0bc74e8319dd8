RACE 3 NO 7 WYLIE RILEY – WIN This two-year-old gelding made a promising debut on the turf at Greyville last time, and despite suffering interference during the running of the race, still managed to finish fourth, just 2.85 lengths off the winner. With the experience under the belt, a move to the Polytrack, and Richard Fourie taking the ride again, Wiley Riley should get off the mark.   He has the best form of the raced runners but there are a few first timers to watch out for. The best of these is Dean Kannemeyer-trained Promettere. It could be wise to take some Swinger with the pair as back-up. RACE 6: QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT 1-LUNAR ECLIPSE AND 10-INGAKARA WITH THE FIELD. Typical low-level handicap on the Polytrack which looks wide open. The two floating banker are consistent runners who should run into the money but who will finish in the other two places is anybody’s guess.
