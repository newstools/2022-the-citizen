So, it was easy for me to connect with him, because he showed me everything that I needed to do. “He improved me as a player, he improved me as a person as well, and I am very grateful to have played alongside him. It was truly amazing to play with him and I will cherish that for the rest of my life.” Shandu did definitely settle well at Pirates, with the former Maritzburg United forcing his way into the starting line-up last season and commanding the right-back position. The former Team of Choice player was instrumental in the Soweto giants’ run in the Caf Confederation Cup, where theylost out in the final on penalties to RS Berkane of Morocco. Just like Jele, Shandu also has a knack for goals as he scored some important goals for the club last campaign. He scored four in the continental tournament, two in the DStv Premiership and one goal in the Nedbank Cup, taking his scoring tally to seven in the 45 games he played for the club.
