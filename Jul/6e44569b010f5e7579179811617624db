While there is nothing wrong with getting someone with a bit of experience to their coach Pitso Dladla, it is known in South Africa that he would take over as coach at some point.  Dladla will be assisted by Ronnie Govender with Msounakis coming in on an overseer position. Biyela also announced former AmaZulu manager James “SMS” Dlamini as their new general manager.  In terms of players, their marquee signing so far is Nkanyiso Zungu who joins on loan from Orlando Pirates. The Natal Rich Boys are still expected to get Zakhele Lepasa also on loan from the Buccaneers.  They also moved quickly to snap up Sibusiso Mthethwa who was one of the players released by Stellenbosch FC on Wednesday while Ndiviwe Mdabuka joins from Cape Town All Stars.  Ntuthuko Mabaso who was recently let go at Pirates is also a part of the new players with striker Michael Gumede returning to the side from Golden Arrows.
