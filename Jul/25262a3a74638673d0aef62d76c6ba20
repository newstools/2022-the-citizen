He is a very important part of our plans going forward, so to have him commit to the side for the next four years is significant for us,” said Bulls director of rugby, Jake White. “Not only is Johan critical for the Bulls, but for South African rugby in general. There is plenty that he offers on and off the field where he provides leadership and is a great mentor for the youngsters around him. We have no doubt that he will continue to make a huge impact at the Vodacom Bulls over the coming years.” Goosen’s contract extension comes on the back of renewals for Morne Steyn (2023), Cornal Hendricks (2024), Jan-Hendrik Wessels (2024), Ruan Nortje (2025), Keagan Johannes (2026), Mornay Smith (2026) and Elrigh Louw (2027).
