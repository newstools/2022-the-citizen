Soggy Manchester weather forced the Proteas and England to play an abridged second ODI at Old Trafford on Friday, with the match reduced to 29 overs-a-side. The Proteas have won the toss and will bowl first. Play was due to start at 2pm South African time (1pm local) but it was still raining heavily at that stage. An inspection was made at 3pm local time once the rain had stopped and then another an hour later (5pm SA time), with umpires David Millns and Richard Illingworth ruling that the match will start at 5.45pm SA time (4.45pm local). The Proteas have made just one alteration to their XI for the match, with all-rounder Dwaine Pretorius coming in for Andile Phehlukwayo, who has concussion after his collision in the field with captain Keshav Maharaj in the first ODI earlier this week.

If the Proteas win the match against the world champions, it would provide an exceptional start to their all-format tour as it would be their first ODI series win in England since 1998.
