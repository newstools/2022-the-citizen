As if dodging taxis and contending with sky-high fuel prices wasn’t enough, Johannesburg motorists now have to be on the lookout for a runaway ostrich. A Twitter user, with the handle @GillianYoungBe1 posted a video on Thursday morning of the ostrich running along a busy road in Joburg. The large bird can be seen cantering along the busy road as cars and trucks race past it. According to the Randburg SPCA, as reported by The Citizen’s sister publication, Randburg Sun, the ostrich was first seen on William Nicol Drive in the early hours of the morning on Tuesday. Randburg SPCA inspector Bradley Hughes said it had not been located by midday on Thursday, but was last seen on the N14 highway in Krugersdorp. “When we got to the first location sent to us, we didn’t find anything. We went around the N1 highway off-ramp from Malibongwe Drive.” He said it is likely that the large bird may now be further away from those locations.
