Dr Irvin Khoza knows that at the end of every season they must go to the courts to determine who is the winner. Football outcomes should be determined on the field of play,” said the Safa president. “We have an integrity officer, he has developed an undertaking that the referees must sign and if we have evidence of match fixing, that referee must go to jail. There must be an end to this thing. The integrity officer has the power to investigate and has an agreement with the Hawks,” he added.
