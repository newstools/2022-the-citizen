I believe that this camp will prove highly beneficial to everyone involved.” Maketa added: “One of the negative effects of Covid-19 was that for the past three years, our teams could not travel to the India where spin is more favourable. Seeing that we play so much cricket in the subcontinent, it is very crucial that we expose our spinners to the subcontinent conditions. “It was important for us not to get left behind with our spin play, hence we’ve come to Durban. We have ensured that we tailormade the wickets to suit spin and challenge our players. “Experienced coaches will be assisting them in not only technically playing spin, but also having the strategy to deal with a spinning ball.” BATTERS: Mihlali Mpongwana, Andile Simelane, Valentine Kitime, Sinethemba Qeshile, Patrick Kruger, Jonathan Bird, Raynard van Tonder, Joshua Richards, Jordan Hermann, Jiveshan Pillay, Ruan De Swart, Levert Manje SPINNERS: Bryce Parsons, Tumelo Tlhokwe, Tshepo Ntuli, Odirile Modimokoane, Prenelan Subrayen, Jason Raubenheimer, Caleb Seleka, Tsepo Ndwandwa, Smangaliso Nhlebela, Bjorn Fortuin, Kurt Mannikam COACHES: Neil McKenzie, Shukri Conrad, Malibongwe Maketa, Paul Adams, Mthandeki Tshabalala.
