Elon Musk says claims that he had an affair with Nicole Shanahan – the ex-wife of Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, is ‘total BS’. Musk’s comments follow reports that his friendship with Brin is over because the Google heavyweight found out about the infidelity.  But, in a Twitter post, the Tesla boss says the story is “total BS” and shared a picture with Brin attending a party together on Monday. Musk dismissed reports of the affair, saying media houses are ‘click maximizing machines’, and a story involving him gets a lot of clicks. “The amount of attention on me has gone supernova, which super sucks. Unfortunately, even trivial articles about me generate a lot of clicks 🙁 Will try my best to be heads down focused on doing useful things for civilization,” Musk said. This is a modal window.

The story was first reported in The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources alleging the affair took place at the Art Basel show in Miami, in December.  Brin and Shanahan were reportedly separated, but still living together at the time. Fans and foes rushed to Musk’s timeline to share their thoughts. One user advised Musk against sexual promiscuity, to which he responded that he hadn’t been sexually active. The same user expressed surprise at Musk’s seemingly lacklustre sex life, pointing out that the 51-year-old has fathered at least eight children so far.
