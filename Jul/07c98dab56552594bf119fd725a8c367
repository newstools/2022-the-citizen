Three United Nations peacekeepers and seven demonstrators have died in anti-UN protests in the eastern DR Congo town of Butembo, police said Tuesday. The fatalities in the UN peacekeeping force MONUSCO were two Indian nationals and a Moroccan, Butembo police chief Paul Ngoma told AFP, giving a provisional toll. Demonstrations in the troubled region erupted Monday, driven by accusations that MONUSCO was failing to act against armed groups.
