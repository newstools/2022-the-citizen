Less than a week after his uncomfortable Durban July “dance-off” with his ex-husband Somizi Mhlongo, Mohale Motaung jetted off to Europe to celebrate his 27th birthday with his besties.   The previous power couple’s ugly divorce details have been widely circulated on social media and in the media in recent weeks. The media personality and SA Idols judge proposed to Mohale on the love lock bridge in Paris back in 2018.

Happy Birthday to me,” Mohale captioned his post. While most people wished Mohale a happy birthday and a beautiful day, others were shocked that he is only 27-years-old. “Lol so Somizi’s child is older than you?” commented Twitter user Ken while @BopheloSebolao tweeted that Mohale should have gone for the daughter, referring to Somizi’s 26-year-old daughter, Bahumi Madisakwane.
