Thursday marks a year since former President Jacob Zuma surrendered to police.  The Constitutional Court had found him guilty of contempt for failing to appear before the Zondo Commission on state capture.  Zuma was taken into custody at the Estcourt Correctional Centre, in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), to begin serving a 15-month prison sentence. Zuma became the first South African president to go to prison since the end of apartheid.

Today, the once-heralded and widely respected liberation movement is synonymous with corruption, state capture and a failed state. Zuma’s arrest sparked days of violent protests across KZN and parts of Gauteng, and racially motivated violence between Indians and Blacks in the province. In the days that followed, social media was awash with messages of plans for violent looting.
