SA Communist Party (SACP) general secretary, Blade Nzimande, will be stepping down after 24 years at the helm of the organisation. Nzimande, who hails from Pietermaritzburg, was elected SACP general secretary in 1998. With the party’s national conference scheduled to kick off in Johannesburg from Wednesday, Nzimande – who is currently the country’s higher education minister, confirmed that he will not be available for re-election. “I’m definitely stepping down as the SACP general secretary. I was elected 24 years ago – It’s a very long time. I thought perhaps it’s time for a new general secretary to take over – someone with new ideas, new energy, new direction and focus.

His opposition to the ANC government’s Growth, Employment, and Redistribution (GEAR) earned him a number of enemies within the ANC. While he initially supported former president Jacob Zuma’s election, he later became a fierce critic of the former president. In 2017 the tensions between Zuma and Nzimande resulted in the former president dropping the outgoing SACP general secretary from cabinet. Under Nzimande’s leadership the SACP membership reportedly grew from about 10 000 to more than 300 000. While Nzimande this week said it was time for a new leader to take over the reins, he added that he would be available to assist the party. I want to make it clear though that I’m not leaving the SACP, nor am I not available to be deployed by the SACP within its structures as it actually sees fit.
