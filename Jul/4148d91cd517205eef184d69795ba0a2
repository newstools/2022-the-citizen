They have been drawn in a tough pool B, along with World Sevens Series leaders Australia, third-placed Fiji and Scotland. Not being a regular in the World Series means they will not be expected to challenge either Australia or Fiji, but their match against Scotland gives them a realistic chance to chase a win in their final pool match of the tournament.
