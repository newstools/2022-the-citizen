Gauteng police have urged the public to avoid sharing messages which may cause panic about a group of school children who have been shot in Orlando East, Soweto. Police say they have noted with concern the voice notes that are being circulating on social media on Tuesday. Police spokesperson, Mavela Masondo, says these voice notes are fake news and an attempt to scare the community and children in particular.

Members of the public are cautioned to refrain from recirculating these voice notes as they cause unnecessary panic in the community, especially among the parents and learners.” ALSO READ: Shooting and robberies: Armed gang terrorises Alexandra
