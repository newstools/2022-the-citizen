BEST BET RACE 3 TRIFECTA: DOUBLE FLOAT 4-FLYING FIRST CLASS AND 5-LAMBORGHREENI WITH 2-WHITE FANG AND 7-ARLINGTON ACTION. Lamboghreeni, White Fang and Flying First Class love this course and distance and are expected to fight this out. Arlington Action is well weighted and must also come into the reckoning. The cost of this bet is just R12 so one could take this a few times if one wishes. VALUE BET RACE 4 No 1 GREEN HAZE – EACHWAY Jockey Richard Fourie and trainer Paul Peter team up in a rare move and although this six-year-old gelding has not won for 861 days, he has become a good place getter and with Fourie up looks decent value at 8-1.
