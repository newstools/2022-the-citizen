Former president Jacob Zuma supporters held a picket outside the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Thursday in remembrance of his arrest a year ago. Thursday marked a year since Zuma was arrested for failing to appear before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into state capture. The arrest was characterised by the looting of businesses and the death of hundreds of people around the province, and in Phoenix in particular. The Constitutional Court sentenced Zuma to 15 months imprisonment for failure to obey a court order which compelled him to appear before the Zondo Commission. He was released on medical parole in September 2021, by former correctional boss Arthur Fraser, a decision which caused a stir both in local and national political circles. On Thursday, the group, which calls itself One Voice – Free Jacob Zuma, said the former president’s arrest was a political ploy by his opponents to discredit him and to ensure that his political gains for the “poor” South Africans were forgotten. “President Zuma’s arrest on the night of July 7, 2021, was undoubtedly the saddest and most tragic moment in South Africa’s judicial history. It is the agents of white monopoly capital and the enemy of the majority’s struggle for economic emancipation who are behind president Zuma’s arrest”, said leader of the group Nkosentsha Shezi on Thursday. They group further called for Cyril Ramaphosa and his allies to step down, and encouraged citizens to take action against the use state machinery to settle political scores.
