Even though my most profound sadness of losing her, I’m grateful that I got to spend time with my mother,” wrote Thembi.  “We stayed together from the beginning until the last day. I’m thankful for the prayers, the teachings, and the love. All That I am today, she prayed for me and believed in me, guys.
