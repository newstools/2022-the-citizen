They equalised late in the game to hold Sundowns to a draw in the first game.  They eventually won the tie on penalties to set up a date with AmaZulu in the final. Richards Bay came out second best in the final.  But they showed their mettle as they held Usuthu to a draw and only lost in the penalty shootout. Richards Bay coach Pitso Dladla is said to be happy with the progress he saw in the team.
