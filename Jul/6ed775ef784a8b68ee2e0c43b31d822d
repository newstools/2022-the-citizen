Light snow is expected to make landfall in a few areas of South Africa and Lesotho on Sunday. Snow Report SA said that snow could be expected in the high lying areas of the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and Lesotho. “No low-level snow at a level reachable by ordinary vehicle is looking likely at this point as the freezing level is likely to be quite high,” it said. Snow Report SA added that the snow forecasts can change significantly in a short space of time. The South African Weather Service (SAWS) also warned that light snowfall could occur in the mountains of Sutherland and Calivinia in the Northern Cape. “Light snowfalls on the mountains could result in isolated loss of vulnerable livestock. Slippery conditions due to icy roads on mountain passes could result in some isolated disruption,” it said.
