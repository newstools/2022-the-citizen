A captain is a leader of men, a player who embodies the core values of the club. He inspires those around him and leads in an exemplary manner – on and off the field.” “Maela not only personifies these values, but he lives them. Throughout his football journey which spans over a ten-year period, the 29-year-old has been consistent; and never allowing a situation (good or bad) change his approach.” Maela rejoined the Buccaneers in 2017 after leaving the club as a youngster. The Bafana Bafana defender went on to play for Witbank Spurs and Thanda Royal Zulu, before returning to the Pirates’ ship. “Maela has come full circle. Starting as a youngster in the Clubs’ Academy ranks in 2012, Inno – as he is affectionately known, went on a five-year long journey away from the club where he went on to cut his teeth, first at Witbank Spurs and then Thanda Royal Zulu,” the statement continued. “In 2017 – where he was captain, the left back led the KZN outfit to promotion to the Premiership. The following season, Maela was recalled to the club where he has since become a regular feature in the club.”
