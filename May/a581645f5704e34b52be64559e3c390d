Last Saturday’s win, albeit in a different competition (the URC), instilled a huge amount of confidence within the group. It’s the kind of momentum we’ll be taking into the Currie Cup game.”  With Jordan Hendrikse on Sevens duty in London, Tiaan Swanepoel takes over the kicking duties from the number 10 position, with James Tedder providing cover on the bench.  In the front row, hooker Morne Brandon gets a starting opportunity. His replacement PJ Botha is set to provide impact later in the match. Reinhard Nothnagel will again captain the side.
