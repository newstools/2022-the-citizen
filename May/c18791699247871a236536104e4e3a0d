TURFFONTEIN INSIDE TRACK BEST BET RACE 3 NO 1 MUFASA – WIN Trainer Paul Peter rates this horse and one needs to put a line through his last run. It was during the rainy period and trainers had problems working their horses and he pulled up fatigued. He will be a lot fitter this time and looks hard to beat. VALUE BET RACE 8 NO 6 QUNETRA – EACHWAY This gelding took a jump in class and was tried in blinkers for the fist time. Neither worked. Back in lower company, the blinkers removed and from a good draw, Roy Magner’s charge should be competitive in this line-up at 14-1 looks an attractive price.
