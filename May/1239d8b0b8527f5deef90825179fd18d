The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has urged customers to use alternative payment methods from 11 May 2022 due to challenges with post office payments. The agency said post offices and normal pay points will not be serviced due to challenges “beyond sassa’s control”. Clients are advised not to go to any post office branch to try to access the funds, according to a statement from Sassa. Customers will receive PINs so they can withdraw the money at retail stores or bank ATMs.  This also affects recipients of the Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress of R350. People can collect their money at these retail outlets:  • Checkers • Usave • Shoprite • Pick ‘n Pay • Boxer People do not necessarily need to withdraw all their money at once, they can withdraw any amount they require and their money will still be safe. Recipients of the R350 grant who chose to collect money at the post office are advised to visit www.srd.sassa.gov.za and change to the retail outlets. “When reporting to a merchants to access the funds, clients must have their Identity Document, Cellphone they registered when applying for the grant because the OTP number will be sent to this registered number.” read the statement. In an interview with SABC the agenda, Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi said the challenges are caused by financial flow problems at post offices. He advised grant recipients to not panic because of the payment changes. “People who used to collect their money at the post office do not necessarily need to panic they can go and transact at any of the particular retail outlets,” said Letsatsi. He said this is also effective as grant recipients are not restricted to collect their money on certain dates. He said they are currently in engagements with Sapo and all relevant stakeholders to resolve this issue. ALSO READ: R350 grant: 7 million people applied since Saturday but there’s limited capacity
