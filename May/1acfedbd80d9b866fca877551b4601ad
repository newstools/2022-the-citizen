Bucs had fought their way back into the game after equalising late in extra-time to make it to make it 1-1 thanks to Thembinkosi Lorch, but the attacker became a hero and a villain in one game as he missed a spot-kick. Pirates had a number of goal scoring chance through,  Deon Hotto, but he failed to beat Berkane keeper Akpabi Hamiani, who made a number of crucial saves to keep his side in the game.The North Africans also had a good chance from Mehdi Oubila after the midfielder connected well with a cross, but his shot went just wide from Richard Ofori’s goals, with the game going into the break goalless. The beginning of the second half saw Bucs once again on a deep search to break the deadlock with an immediate attack, but Hotto’s attempt was once again saved by the Berkane shot-stopper. Later on, after making a number of good saves, the Moroccan side keeper caused a scare after he caught the boot of Shandu, but he was able to get back to the game later on, as the 90 minutes finished goalless.Going into extra-time, it was a bad start for Bucs midfielder Thabang Monare, who caused a penalty following a VAR check after coming on as a substitute. Yousef el Fahli stepped up to make it 1-0 for the North African team. Bucs tried their all make their way back into the game, and they finally did thanks to their determination which saw Lorch equalising with only a couple of minutes left to full-time, which forced the game to go to penalties. However, the Soweto giants could not go on to win the trophy as they lost 5-4 on penalties with Lorch being the only one missing the penalty.
