The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) will embark on a strike on Wednesday demanding a 10% wage increase. The union served the management of ArcelorMittal South Africa (Amsa) with a 48-hour notice.

The union rejected the proposal. Ramokhathali claims workers at Amsa are paid low salaries, considering the size of the company. “We reject this proposal. What is a 5% increase for the lowest paid worker who earns approximately R7000? It is not much at all,” Ramokhathali concluded.
