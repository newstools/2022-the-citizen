You may ask what is a wine brandy? It is a rich, decadent brandy that has flavours of sweet vanilla, spice, and rose water, ending with a velvety finish. Van Ryn’s started out as a Chenin Blanc and Colombar wine. The base of the wine was then distilled in copper pot stills, one of which is over 200 years old and used daily. Describing the wine brandy, Bester said: “The low wine coming off the stills was separated into three parts: the head, heart, and tail. Only the clear and pure liquid from the heart is used to craft Van Ryn’s brandies, and after a second distillation prepared for maturation.
