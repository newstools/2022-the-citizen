There is a huge amount at stake in this weekend’s final round of the United Rugby Championship with three home quarter-finals and three regional shields all up for grabs. Quarter-final 1 (QF1) – the team ranked first in the Standing League Table will play at home against the team ranked eighth in the Standing League Table. Quarter-final 2 (QF2) – the team ranked second in the Standing League Table will play at home against the team ranked seventh in the Standing League Table. Quarter-final 3 (QF3) – the team ranked third in the Standing League Table will play at home against the team ranked sixth in the Standing League Table. Quarter-final 4 (QF4)– the team ranked fourth in the Standing League Table will play at home against the team ranked fifth in the Standing League Table. The winners of the quarter-final matches will proceed to the semi-finals. The semi-finals will be knock-out, each played over one match and organised as follows: Semi-final 1 (SF1) – the winner of QF1 versus the winner of QF4. The winner of QF1 will be the ‘home’ team. Semi-final 2 (SF2) – the winner of QF2 versus the winner of QF3. The winner of QF2 will be the ‘home’ team. Grand Final – the winner of SF1 versus the winner of SF2. The Semi-final winner possessing the highest ranking from the Standing League Table will be the ‘home’ team for the URC Grand Final. This is subject to the highest-ranked semi-final winner having access to a venue with a capacity of 18,000 and above. Points in all URC games contribute to Shield standings so victories against regional rivals have added importance when it comes to finishing top of the group and locking up a place in the Heineken Champions Cup. Shield opponents also face each team within their group home and away (6 games) while facing the remaining 12 URC teams just once (home or away). Seedings for Champions Cup will be based upon the league ranking of all eight teams.
