The life-changing R126 million Powerball jackpot in Friday’s draw goes to one lucky Lotto player from Florida in Roodepoort, Johannesburg.  The player spent R22.50 via the quick-pick selection at at Superspar on Goldman Street, bagging the massive R126,589,752.05 pot.  According to Ithuba Holdings, the South African Lottery operation, the winnings from draw 1,303 are not yet claimed.  The player is urged to visit Ithuba offices to process their winnings.  Ithuba CEO Charmaine Mabuza said: “We congratulate our latest multi-millionaire. … On this note, we also urge all other players to continue to check their tickets, as there are a number of unclaimed tickets due to expire in six months.” As at 30 April 2022, a whopping R279,451,903 has yet to be claimed across the Ithuba portfolio, including the smaller prize winnings.  Winnings totalling R109,760,846.40 due to expire within the next six months. Unclaimed winnings from expired tickets will be transferred to the National Lottery Distribution Trust Fund, “for reallocation to good causes”. “From time to time, a small portion of unclaimed and expired funds are used to support the popular Guaranteed Jackpot Programme.” A recent big win saw R94,446,937 million of a R134 million prize pot claimed when someone spent R25.00 on a quick pick selection purchased on a banking app.  Meanwhile, Ithuba has warned South Africans to be careful of fake jackpot notifications. “The only way to win with the National Lottery is to buy and be in possession of a winning ticket. The National Lottery will never send you an email or SMS stating the value of your winning or asking for your details in order to claim your winnings.” Winners who receive winnings of R50,000 and above receive free trauma counselling and financial advice from professional psychologists and a team of financial advisors at no additional cost.
