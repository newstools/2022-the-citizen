We don’t ride roughshod over our people, we listen and Minister Mthethwa was able to say ‘yes president we will pull this thing and besides that the cost was just too high.’” “It’s a wonderful project, pull it, we shelve it, we will see it once our economy is flying, then we will see it,” Ramaphosa said. Many South Africans were outraged by the cost of the flag and said the money could be put to better use like helping the poor. The feasibility study was expected to cost the taxpayer R5 million while the installation of the 100-metre-long flag will cost R17 million. Mthethwa initially defended the project as part of his department’s mandate to foster social cohesion. On Tuesday, trade union federation Cosatu slammed Mthethwa for ignoring poor South Africans by spending R22 million on the flag and called for him to be fired.
