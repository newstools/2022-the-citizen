Only a handful of airlines fly non-stop over such vast distances, which present a host of challenges including the capability of planes, commercial viability, and even the health of crew and passengers. Singapore Airlines Flight SQ24 to New York’s John F. Kennedy International airport is currently the longest commercial journey in the world, taking passengers more than 15,000 kilometres from the city-state to the eastern United States on Airbus A350-900s. It also operates the second-longest journey – Flight SQ22, also on A350-900s, to Newark in the US state of New Jersey is scheduled at 18 hours and 25 minutes. Qantas will use the A350-1000 variant for its planned Sydney-London flights.

The flights were originally operated between London and the western city of Perth, but were moved to Darwin because of Covid-linked travel restrictions in Australia. Qantas has said it will resume the Perth-London route this year. Singapore Airlines Flight SQ35 takes passengers more than 14,000 km over the Pacific Ocean from Los Angeles on the US West Coast to the Asian city-state in 17 hours and 10 minutes. The carrier’s San Francisco-Singapore flight is scheduled at 16 hours and 40 minutes.

The flight path will cover “just under 9,000 nautical miles” (10,357 miles) – or 16,668 kilometres – in 16 to 17 hours, the airline told AFP in a statement. It declined to be drawn into why its flight path gave a wide berth to Russia’s airspace, which it has previously flown through, according to Bloomberg. Many airlines have cancelled routes to Russian cities or are avoiding Russian airspace over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Cathay Pacific said the decision was taken because “strong seasonal tailwinds” made the new route more favourable.
