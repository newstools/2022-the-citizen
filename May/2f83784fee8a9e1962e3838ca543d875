The Bulls have selected a strong team to take on Griquas in a crucial Currie Cup encounter at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday. The side from Tshwane sit at the top of the Currie Cup table and will be out to retain their log-leading status ahead of the unbeaten Cheetahs as well as the Sharks. The Bulls will be expecting a strong challenge from the Griquas, who will be looking to turn around the result from the previous fixture between the two sides when the men in blue claimed an emphatic 27-53 victory away from home in Kimberley in March.
