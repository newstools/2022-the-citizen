Caster Semenya will make her international championship debut over the 5,000m distance next month after the three-time 800m world champion was included in the South African team yesterday for the African Championships in Mauritius. Since being sidelined by World Athletics gender regulations, preventing her from competing over her specialist distances (400m – 1,500m) without taking hormone suppressants, Semenya had dabbled in the 200m sprint before focussing on the 5,000m event.

But while her personal best of 15:31.50, set in Cape Town last month, was more than 20 seconds outside the qualifying standard of 15:10.00 for the World Championships to be held in Eugene in July, it was enough to secure her spot in the continental squad.

Six athletes have also been included in a powerful 4x100m relay squad – Simbine, Clarence Munyai, Henricho Bruintjies, Emile Erasmus, Sinesipho Dambile and Benjamin Richardson – who will turn out in defence of their continental title. The African Athletics Championships will be held for the first time since the 2018 edition in Asaba, Nigeria, due to postponements and cancellations caused by the Covid pandemic.
