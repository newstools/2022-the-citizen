Steve Barker was understandably delighted after Stellenbosch FC stunned champions Mamelodi Sundowns at TUKS Stadium on Saturday, some clinical attacking play sinking Masandawana 3-0 in the DStv Premiership.

We have one more game against Cape Town City but have achieved our objective of finishing in the top eight and now we can dream of finishing even higher up the table. So this was a magnificent day for us,” added Barker. Sundowns had already wrapped up the title, of course, so could be forgiven an off-day in the circumstances, but co-head coach Rulani Mokwena still reserved plenty of praise for Barker and his side. “It was one of those things that happen in football,” said Mokwena. “Congrats to Stevie Barker. If this has to happen I would rather it happens to Stevie … he is an incredible gentleman, and incredible servant of the game, and has made a lot of history on this pitch (Barker was head coachat TUKS from 2008-2014, getting them promoted to the Premiership in 2012). “Some things are written in the stars and we have to accept it.”
