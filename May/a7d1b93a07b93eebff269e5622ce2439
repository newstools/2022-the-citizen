Zuma was incarcerated at the time for contempt of the Constitutional Court and South Africa was under alert level 4 lockdown. All gatherings were prohibited at the time, except for funerals. During his arrest, Niehaus was given the option to pay an admission of guilt fine of R3,000. However, he refused to pay tand chose to challenge the charges in court.

The postponement was granted by the court. Senior state advocate Yuri Gangai advised the court that the NPA was ready to proceed with the trial.
