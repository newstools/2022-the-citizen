Nothing is for free, Minister of Fisheries, Forestry and Environment Barbara Creecy said when handing over a new waste disposal truck to the Collins Chabane municipality on Monday.  In return for the investment, the leaders of the municipality, and other affected municipalities have to up their game at Kruger National Parks’ entrances.  Local government officials also received a skip loader, with a combined value of more than R5 million, for waste collection and processing waste at landfills.

All the rubbish collected here is taken to Thulamela [municipal] dump. There’s a lot of travelling for the trucks.”  It’s a round trip of about 100km. People also throw rubbish in the bush and some gets into streams which run into Nandoni Dam.
