Speaking to etv at the time of Bartlett’s exit from the show, Rhythm City director Eric Mogale, described Bartlett as a “gentle giant”. “Working with Bartlett was like being surrounded by greatness on a daily basis, a gentle giant, teacher and obviously talent. He is a multi-talented man. Shooting his exit was one of the greatest story lines that I had to deal with in my entire career and it gave me a lot of anxiety, sleepless nights knowing that a great teacher is leaving our floor,” he said.
