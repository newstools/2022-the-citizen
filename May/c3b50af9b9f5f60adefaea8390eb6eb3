The Daily Show host Trevor Noah became the first African to host the White House Correspondents’ dinner, and the comedian has received stellar reviews.  The correspondents’ dinner is an annual black-tie event that sees the United States president invite and have a laugh with distinguished guests.  It is organised by the White House Correspondents’ Association as it honours several journalists for their contributions to media.  They pick the headlining act and this year it was our very own Noah, as he wasn’t afraid to trade jokes about politicians, journalists and celebrities attending the event.  The dinner hasn’t occurred in two years due to the pandemic. However, it took a bit longer to return because former US President Donald Trump never attended the annual dinner, which is a tradition for a leading statesman to do so.  Noah poked fun at Trump, President Joe Biden, politicians, the press, and joked about the Oscar’s slap and Covid-19. He was aware that his jokes may land him in trouble.  ALSO READ: ‘Happy heavenly birthday’ – The Fergusons mark Shona’s birthday “It is risky making jokes these days. I mean, we all saw what happened at the Oscars. I’ve actually been a little worried about tonight.  “What if I make a really mean joke about Kellyanne Conway… and then her husband rushes up on the stage and thanks me?” he said.  Noah did receive much praise from both sides of the political realm as he wasn’t afraid to call out leaders from the left and the right.  Back home he has always championed South Africa. Last week the host called on people to donate funds in aid to KwaZulu-Natal flood victims.  During the end of a segment on the Daily Show, Noah asked people to send their relief funds to the Gift of the Givers Foundation, imploring them to send any amount of money if they could.  The humanitarian organisation has been applauded for its efforts to lend a helping hand in the flood-hit province, in which approximately 430 people have died.
