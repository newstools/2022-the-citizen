Limpopo police are searching for two suspects who were seen shoving a 31-year-old woman into the boot of a motor vehicle and driving off. The incident took place on Monday in the Kgaphamadi village under Hlogolou policing area outside Groblersdal.  Neighbours reported seeing two unidentified men grab 31-year-old Refiloe Malope and forcefully shoved her into the boot of a white Toyota sedan. The suspects then headed towards Motsephiri. “The information at our disposal is that the victim was allegedly approached by one of the suspects under the pretext that he was looking for assistance as his vehicle was having a breakdown in the village,” said Provincial Commissioner of Police in Limpopo Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe.
