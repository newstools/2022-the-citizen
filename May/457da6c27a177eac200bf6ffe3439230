A team of contractors have been appointed to repair damaged infrastructure and restore basic services in Umdloti, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), after the second wave of floods hit the area over the weekend. Part of the work will include the installation of two larger diameter pipes from Bellamont Road to Umdloti Beach in order to prevent mud slides. “Upon inspection, our engineers discovered that sand build-up on Bellamont Road had caused water to cross from one side to the other and this caused damage to properties,” eThekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda said. “However, with the municipality installing these two high density polyethylene pipes with inlets on both sides, water coming from the nearby forest will be channelled to the sea to prevent future damage to nearby properties and municipal infrastructure,” said Kaunda. The area’s water treatment plant is in process of being fixed and the trunk sewer line in Prince Mhlangana at the Riverhorse Valley Business Park will be repaired.
