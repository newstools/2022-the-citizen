New Lions signing Sanele Nohamba is set to make his debut off the bench in their Currie Cup match against the Cheetahs at Ellis Park on Friday night. The Lions have named a stacked side with a number of United Rugby Championship (URC) regulars, while exciting scrumhalf Nohamba, who recently made his switch to the union from the Sharks after falling down the pecking order there, is named among the substitutes. “I am really looking forward to making my debut off the bench on Friday, it is very exciting. I am really looking forward to the game against the Cheetahs,” exclaimed Nohamba.
