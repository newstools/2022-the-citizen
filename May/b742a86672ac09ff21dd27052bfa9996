Sundowns were meant to receive their DStv Premiership trophy this evening as they had already secured their fifth successive league title, but following the decision by match commissioner Maurne Daniels, Masandawana players will have to wait a while longer to get their gold medals around their necks. “The pitch is not going to get any better because of the heavy rain and the league will decide on when the game will be replayed and they will give the teams all the details. The game will have to restart because of waterlogged pitch,” said Daniels The match is likely to be rescheduled for Sunday or early next week as the Brazilians will need to be given ample time to prepare for the Nedbank Cup final against Marumo Gallants at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium next week Saturday.
