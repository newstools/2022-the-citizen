The Volkswagen plant in Uitenhage, now known as Kariega, has officially produced its one-millionth, export market Polo. Bound for the United Kingdom, the millionth Polo takes the number of models made at the facility since 2002 to 1 292 793.  In total, 4 181 031 Polos have so far been assembled since the Seat Cordoba derived models bearing the Polo Classic and Playa names began rolling out of the plant in 1996. At present, the Polo is exported to 38 countries with the Kariega Plant being the only facility in the world that produces the Polo GTI in right-hand-drive.
