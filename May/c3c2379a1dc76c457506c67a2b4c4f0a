The semifinal encounter of the cup will be played at the CCM Kirumba Stadium in Mwanza Region and the two teams are currently in final preparations. Yanga and Simba were in Mwanza Region playing their Mainland Tanzania NBC Premier League matches, but after the encounters, Yanga, who are the hosts of the match, left the Rock City for Shinyanga to set up residential camp while Simba decided to remain in the region and camped at Misungwi.
