Mother’s Day is an international holiday set to take place every year on the second Sunday of May in honour of mother’s and the love, support and dedication they put into raising their children. The origins of the special day date back to the early 1900’s when a lady from Philadelphia, Ann Jarvis held a memorial service at her late mother’s church in Grafton, West Virginia to mark the special day as a tribute to her mother who had frequently organized women’s groups to promote friendship and health. Within five years, many states adopted the holiday honouring Jarvis’s mother, and mother’s across the world, and in 1914 U.S. President Woodrow Wilson made it an official national holiday. In celebration of Mother’s Day, we have put together delicious and wholesome recipes for you and the family to recreate to spoil your mother on her special day.
