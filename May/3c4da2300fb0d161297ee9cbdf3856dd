Former Bafana Bafana striker Siyabonga Nomvete believes the election of Samuel Eto’o as Cameroon Football Federation’s president is a good precedent that should be followed across the continent.  Eto’o was elected to lead the CFF in December last year in a move that has been hailed as positive across the globe.

Among them was to hire former Indomitable Lions teammate Rigobert Song as national team coach.  “It is a big thing and we appreciate that happening especially because they were big players in their time,” says Nomvete.  “They played at the top level and made their name. It is important for people like thom to get into leadership positions in their local associations and impart the knowledge that they have acquired.  “It brings us back to the fact that former players are the best for taking our game forward. Their progress is inspiring us that we need to take ownership of our football.”  Former Ivory Coast striker, Didier Drogba also tried to follow in Eto’o’s footsteps in his bative country but was not so lucky as he was not elected.  Drogba was eliminated in the first round of voting last month, but he has vowed to come back again in the next elections.  In South Africa, Doctor Khumalo has questioned the exclusion of former Bafana players in the Safa structures. This brought back the debates on who could lead the association among the former players.  Lucas Radebe’s name has again come out tops as the best candidate for the position currently held by long-time servant of the local game Danny Jordaan.
