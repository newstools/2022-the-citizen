Liverpool attacker Mo Salah has already talked of Liverpool wanting revenge for that defeat, but Klopp has played down the idea. “I don’t believe in revenge, I understand it, but I don’t think you have ever heard of revenge being a fantastic idea,” said Klopp. “I understand what Mo said. He wants to put it right. I want to put it right. In Germany we say ‘you always meet twice in life’ that sounds like more of a threat than it is. It is that you should behave well in the first moment you meet, because (otherwise) if you meet again you will get a reaction. It is fine between me and us and Madrid.”
