Makofane’s Cape Town-based construction company allegedly submitted fraudulent value added tax (VAT) claim invoices to the South African Revenue Service (Sars). Mafokane and Magheje submitted the invoices through e-filing for their company, Machembe Construction and Projects CC. R9.9 million was then transferred into their company’s account, according to the police. It was after the transfer that Sars noticed the fraudulent documents and conducted an internal analysis investigation. “The matter was reported to the Hawks for investigation which resulted in a warrant of arrest issued against the alleged perpetrators,” read the statement. Both of the accused are expected to appear in court on 29 June 2022 for docket disclosure. NOW READ: Father and son arrested for R99 debit order syndicate
