Eskom has announced that stage 2 load shedding will continue from 5pm until 10pm on Wednesday due to the failure of three generation units.  The parastatal said two generation units at Hendrina power station and one at Matimba power station were taken offline for repairs.  Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said one generation unit at Arnot Power Station was returned to service. “A generation unit each at Kusile and Tutuka power stations are expected to return to service thisafternoon. We currently have 2,329MW on planned maintenance, while another 15,988MW of capacity isunavailable due to breakdowns.”  ALSO READ: R1.5 billion diesel per month: Eskom burning more than ever during load shedding “The onset of winter has seen increased demand and this will lead to capacity constraints throughoutthis period, particularly during the evening and morning peaks. Unfortunately, this would generallyrequire the implementation of load shedding during the evening peaks,” Mantshantsha said.  Meanwhile, Eskom is expected to brief the media on Wednesday on the state of the system and also on the company’s operation performance.  The dark lords of Megawatt Park reminded the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid.
