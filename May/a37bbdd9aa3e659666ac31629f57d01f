Angry members of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on Sunday afternoon disrupted Cosatu’s May Day Rally in Rustenburg, North West. The workers, who are believed to be part of striking mineworkers at Sibanye-Stillwater, refused to be addressed by President Cyril Ramaphosa, accusing him of not caring about the plight of the poor and working class.

Members of NUM and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) are demanding an increase of R1,000 a month, but Sibanye-Stillwater is offering R850 each year for three years. Chaos broke out when the workers stormed the main stage at Royal Bafokeng Stadium, where Ramaphosa was set to address Cosatu’s International Workers’ Day rally. This led to a scuffle between the workers and the South African Police Services’ public order members. Ramaphosa tried twice to intervene to calm the situation, but his efforts did not help.  The president was later whisked away from the stadium by police and his security after the workers demanded that he left.  The hostile reception eventually led to Ramaphosa’s address being abandoned.
