Pitso Mosimane’s Al Ahly have decided to lodge a complaint against Caf to the Court of Arbitration (Cas)for Sport following the African football controlling body’s decision to host the Caf Champions League final in Morocco.ALSO READ: Mosimane questions Caf’s decision to award hosting of Champions League final to Morocco Caf made the announcement on Tuesday, stating they have awarded Morocco the rights to host the final after the withdrawal of Senegal in the bidding process of hosting the tournament. But, this hasn’t sat well with the Egyptians, who believe Morocco hosting the final for the second year in a row is wrong and more especially, it will give Wydad Casablanca a home ground advantage. Casablanca have a good chance of reaching the final, with the side having beaten Petro Luanda 3-1 in the first leg of the semi-finals, while Al Ahly thrashed Algerian club ES Setif 4-0 at home. “Al Ahly SC decided to present an appeal to Cas (Court of Arbitration for Sport) against the decision of the Confederation of African Football (Caf) of  not holding the 2022 Caf Champions League final in a neutral venue, aside from the venues of the four semi-finalists. In addition to other violations that do not meet the Olympic Charter, Fifa and Caf regulations,” read part of the statement from the Egyptian club. “The club has previously demanded Caf to play the game in a neutral venue and will appeal against Caf’s decision, requesting Cas to resolve the situation before the competition’s final.” “Caf announced in their statement, which was published yesterday (Tuesday) on Caf’s official platforms, the chosen venue to host the game and mentioned in the same statement that they are in discussions to revert to the old two-legged home and away final.” Meanwhile, Mosimane and his charges will travel to Algiers for the second leg of the semi’s on Saturday, while Wydad will host Petro the day before.
