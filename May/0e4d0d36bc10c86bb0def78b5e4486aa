Motshwari has not been playing much for Pirates lately and negotiations with the team’s management are said to be the reason why.  “Listen, I don’t think Ben will be with the team next season,” said the source.  “His contract is ending at the end of the season and apparently he has been offered a huge deal by Kaizer Chiefs. They want him and they are not the only team that wants him, that club from Durban (AmaZulu) also wants him. So, the way things are going, it’s all up to him.”
