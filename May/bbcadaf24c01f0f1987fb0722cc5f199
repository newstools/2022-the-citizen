A Durban man is expected to appear in court on charges of fraud for allegedly altering his matric certificate points 12 years ago to gain admission to medical school. The 29-year-old man from Imbilo is reportedly scheduled to appear in the Durban Specialised Commercial Crime Court on 31 May 2022. “It is alleged that the suspect forged his matric certificate and altered the pass marks to gain admission at the university in 2010,” said Hawks spokesperson Simphiwe Mhlongo. The medical school discovered the fraudulent certificate four years into his studies. “Whilst he was doing the fourth year at medical school, it was discovered that he used a fraudulent certificate,” Mhlongo added in a statement.
