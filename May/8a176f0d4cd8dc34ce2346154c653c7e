Just like Pirates, Thwihli Thwahla are also eyeing a second place finish.“The focus now is KZN’s Royal AM, it’s going to be a difficult game, so we have to prepare ourselves. It was important to boost our confidence because we still have a chance to qualify for Caf (Champions League). So, we needed this win.” Lorch also thanked the club’s fans for their loyal support and urged them to keep on rallying behind so that they can win their matches. “What I would like to say to our fans is that they should continue supporting us and we will always keep on pushing. It doesn’t when we lose we do it on purpose. But, their support is very important, like today (Tuesday), they pushed us even though it was difficult for us, but just kept on pushing,” he added. Pirates are in sixth place on the standings with 43 points with two games remaining to end their campaign. A win against Royal AM will put them in a good position to go on and finish the season as runners-up to Mamelodi Sundowns as only six points separate them with second-placed Cape Town City, who are on 49 points.
