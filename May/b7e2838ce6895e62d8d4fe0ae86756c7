Eskom has announced that stage 2 load shedding will again continue on Thursday from 5pm until 10pm due to a shortage of generation capacity during the evening peak. The parastatal said a generating unit at Lethabo Power Station was taken offline for repairs last night. Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said one generation unit each at Kusile and Tutuka power stations were returned to service. “A generation unit each at Matimba and Tutuka power stations are expected to return to service this afternoon. We currently have 2 379MW on planned maintenance, while another 15 365MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns.” “The onset of winter has seen increased demand and this will lead to capacity constraints throughout this period, particularly during the evening and morning peaks. Unfortunately, this would generally require the implementation of loadshedding during the evening peaks,” Mantshantsha said Mantshantsha said loadshedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. We therefore urge all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly especially between 05:00 – 09:00 in the mornings and 16:00 – 22:00 in the evening,” Mantshantsha said.
