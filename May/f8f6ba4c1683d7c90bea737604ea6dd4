Lions head coach Ivan van Rooyen has named a 28-man squad, minus regular captain Burger Odendaal, for his team’s final Rugby Championship match against Welsh outfit Dragons. In Odendaal’s absence – the centre will be joining English side Wasps at the end of the season – lock Reinhardt Nothnagel will lead the side. The Lions will leave Joburg on Tuesday evening.

However, it offers a few our players an opportunity to impress.” Flank Vincent Tshituka, who had visa issues the last time the Lions went abroad, has been included in the group on this occasion and will travel with his team-mates, however, his brother, Emmanuel, is injured and will stay at home. Some of the young players who’ll tour include Asenathi Ntlabakanye, Jarod Cairns, Morne Brandon, Matt More and Van Wyk. Joining Odendaal at home will be Carlu Sadie and Wandisile Simelane, who also haven’t been included in the tour group.
