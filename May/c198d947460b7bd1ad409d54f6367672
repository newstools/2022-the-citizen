It was a tough game for Chelsea. Jordan Pickford stole the show on Sunday and made a number of telling saves to ensure Everton came away with three important points in their attempt to avoid relegation. Everton got a free-kick straight from the kick-off when Anthony Gordon was fouled by Ruben Loftus-Cheek, and the gripping first half set the mood for the rest of the match.  Two minutes into the second half at Goodison Park, Richarlison netted the goal after Cesar Azpilicueta dallied on the ball and was closed down by Richarlison. This is a modal window.

A mistake Chelsea will come to rue; it let Richarlison through to score the winner. A tense first half saw five yellow cards but not as many goalscoring chances. Everton moved two points away from safety as Richarlison’s goal handed Lampard a priceless victory. The Toffees missed the chance to put the game beyond doubt as Vitaliy Mykolenko was handed a golden opportunity when Doucoure skipped a challenge from Loftus-Cheek. Pickford saved the day again as Everton’s defensive line held, and he thwarted an attempt from Kovacic. Despite beating Chelsea 1-0, Everton are still two points behind Burnley and Leeds with a game in hand. Seamus Coleman said Everton believed they could win, despite “not many giving us a chance today”. He added:  “The football club means everything to these fans and we had to replicate that today. But it’s only three points and we’re still in a massive scrap.” He said Pickford’s save was “world-class”.  “There’s a reason why he’s England’s number one. Without Jordan, we wouldn’t have won the game.” Note: Top four qualify for Champions League; Europa League and Europa Conference League places to be decided; bottom three relegated
