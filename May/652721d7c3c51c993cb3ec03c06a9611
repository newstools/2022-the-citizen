I played a lot of times here. So, it’s overwhelming and I am so happy to be here. I just hope it brings all the good luck and the support that we need. I think it is going to be a difficult game, it is not going to be easy. We watched the opponents, we analysed them. It is not going to be easy, we know it is going to be a tough game, but we need the Cup,” said Ndah.
