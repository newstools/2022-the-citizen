Kabelo “Prince Kaybee” Motsamai will be leaving a legacy for his son after the music producer made some impressive business moves.  It was reported by entertainment reporter Phil Mphela that Prince Kaybee had bought a stake in Blue Crane Vineyards at Tulbagh farm in the Western Cape.  The artist all but confirmed the news by retweeting congratulations messages under the post.  As part of the partnership, Prince Kaybee will have a wine called Milani, named after his son. Prince Kaybee and Zola Ayabulela Mhlongo welcomed a baby boy late last year.  The Milani wine is a pinot noir rose and shiraz and only a limited stock will be sold. Tulbagh is a wine and olive farm whose products include extra virgin olive oil and Chenin blanc.  The slogan of the pinot rose wine is a quote from Prince Kaybee which is; “When there’s music there’s life and where there’s life there’s wine.” In his personal life, it is not yet known whether Prince Kaybee and Mhlongo are still in a relationship or not. The TV presenter has chosen to share minimal pictures of their son on her Instagram page whilst Prince Kaybee has taken the route of sharing a bit more.   The last picture Zola posted was a Christmas Day photoshoot, which saw her posing with three other family members, and her son.
