The ANC Johannesburg regional conference that was set to take place this weekend has been pushed back by at least two weeks.  This was announced on Wednesday by the region. “The ANC greater Johannesburg Regional Task Team (RTT) has resolved to postpone the conference to the 27-29 May 2022 based on the report of the Regional Disputes Committee (RDC) to give branches an opportunity to re-run and those who wish to appeal RDC decisions.” The party’s Regional Dispute Resolution Committee Report highlighted that 43 branches had lodged disputes with their BBGMs (Branch Biennial General Meetings) and in terms of all disputes received, less than 10 branches will be required to reconvene their meetings if not yet convened. The ANC is currently holding elective conferences in different provinces leading up to the much-anticipated national elective conference in December, with the latest conference having re-elected Oscar Mabuyane as Eastern Cape chairperson.

The Johannesburg region also said that it has since received an update on the status of front runner Mpho Moerane, who is hospitalised following a car accident. “The RTT is encouraged by his recovery progress.” While the circumstances surrounding the car crash were unclear, TimesLIVE reported on Tuesday that Moerane was involved in a “horrible” crash late on Monday night and he was admitted to a Johannesburg hospital. Sources who spoke to the news website said Moerane apparently slipped into a coma after being resuscitated when his heart stopped on Tuesday morning. The ANC requested the public to give the family and party space to provide support to Moerane to ensure his full recovery.
