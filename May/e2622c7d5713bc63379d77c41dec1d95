The Judicial service commission has made calls to the public to make written submissions on the suitability of the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) President Justice Mandisa Maya for appointment as the Deputy Chief Justice. Back in February, the JSC recommended Maya for the position of Chief Justice, a move that President Cyril Ramaphosa went against and instead appointed Justice Raymond Zondo. With Justice Zondo’s promotion, meaning that the position of Deputy Chief Justice became vacant. Ramaphosa then indicated his intention to nominate Maya for the position of Deputy Chief Justice. “Law bodies, members of the public, and all other institutions with an interest in the work of the JSC are invited to make written submissions, if any, on the suitability or otherwise of Justice Maya for appointment as the Deputy Chief Justice and any other information which they deem to be relevant to the selection process.” the JSC said in a statement on Wednesday.
