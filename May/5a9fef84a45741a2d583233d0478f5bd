The destruction and loss on every level has been devastating and heart-breaking, impacting a great many lives, especially those in informal settlements.  Hundreds of displaced families have been affected in multiple ways, and the numbers continue to grow. It has been confirmed that more than 400 people have lost their lives. The Dis-Chem Foundation are busy assisting with basic humanitarian necessities in areas traumatised by the flooding through the Humanitarian Empowerment Fund (HEF), a vetted aid relief organisation that has been on the ground in KZN from the beginning and are taking care of distribution on behalf of the Foundation. With the funds donated by the Dis-Chem Foundation, HEF have been working tirelessly to ensure food, water and other basic essentials reach destitute families in disaster-struck areas, starting with a community in ward 19 near Pinetown who were in dire need of assistance. HEF concentrated their efforts on providing approximately 80 000 litres of water to critical areas such as clinics and temporary shelters including one in Clermont currently housing 65 families, as well as food parcels and toiletries for these and other families who have been left with absolutely nothing. The Dis-Chem Foundation assisted first with this Pinetown community but will continue to further aid displaced communities where they can as the fallout from this devastating national disaster becomes more apparent over the coming weeks. We are ever grateful to all who are working on the ground and navigating through hard hit areas to ensure those in need are reached. The Dis-Chem Foundation, caring for the community.
