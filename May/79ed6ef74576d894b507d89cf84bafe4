Then in 2014, the focus was once again on Crimea and parts of Donbas during the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity, resulting in the regions being internationally recognised as part of Ukraine.  At the time, the Euromaidan protests resulted in the removal of President Viktor Yanukovych on 22 February 2014.
