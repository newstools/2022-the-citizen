RACE 6 SWINGER: 1-SATOSHI AND 6-MANZ KNIGHT Manz Knight looks one of the best bets on the card and Satoshi looks the only likely danger based on exposed form. They should fight it out so one could even consider playing Exactas with the two. RACE 4 NO 13 UP THE IRISH – EACHWAY This filly has run twice and found betting support on both occasions. She showed a lot of pace in her last start over 1100m, showing a lot of pace before starting to hang and then fading late.
