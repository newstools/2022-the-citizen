A 28-man Bulls squad will travel to Wales this week for their crucial United Rugby Championship match against Ospreys in Swansea. Although a playoff spot has already been secured, the Tshwane-based side will travel to Europe where they will want to put themselves in a good position for a potential home quarter-final spot, depending on permutations of other fixtures this weekend, should they secure a victory in their final round-robin match on Friday night.

We are at a crucial stage of the competition – the business end of the round-robin stages and on the verge of the playoffs, with plenty to play for in terms of securing home quarter-final spots,” said White. “Be that as it may, the focus is on playing well as a group this week and to start building good momentum going into the playoffs.” ALSO READ: In-form Leinster fire ominous warning at other URC contenders The match will be played at the Swansea.com (Liberty) Stadium, kicking off at 9.10pm on Friday.
