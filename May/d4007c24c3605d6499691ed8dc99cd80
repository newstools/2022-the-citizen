Stats SA released the quarterly labour force survey for the first quarter of 2022 on Tuesday. South Africa’s unemployment rate decreased as 370,000 jobs were gained.  The community and social services sector recorded the biggest increase in job gains (approximately 281,000), followed by manufacturing with 263,000 jobs.  Meanwhile, job losses recorded in private households (186,000), were from finance (72,000), construction (60,000) and agriculture (23,000). As per Stats SA’s report, 14.9 million individuals were employed during the first quarter of 2022 – an increase from the 14.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  In addition, some 60,000 of South Africa’s 7.9 million unemployed citizens re-entered the workforce this quarter. South Africa’s official unemployment rate thus decreased by 0.8 of a percentage point from 35.3% in 2021 to 34.5% in the first quarter of 2022. Black South African women and youth were most affected by unemployment during 2021’s fourth quarter – as per the report released on 29 March 2022.  South Africa soared past the 35% threshold after with a 0.4% percentage point increase from the previous quarter, while unemployed persons total 7.9 million. Unemployment among Black African women skyrocketed to 42,4% during Q4 – approximately 4.2 percentage points higher than the national average. Meanwhile, a PwC report on South Africa’s economic outlook in light of rising inflation rates highlighted the hopelessness felt by millions of job seekers in South Africa.
