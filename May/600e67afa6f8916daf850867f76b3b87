Dumisani Zuma’s career at Kaizer Chiefs may well be over after the club announced that their attacking star had been suspended for a second time.  ALSO READ: Amrouche throws his name in the hat for Chiefs job “The Club is disappointed to report that Dumsani Zuma has been suspended once again pending an internal disciplinary process,” read a statement from the club on their official website.  “Zuma has just returned from a 10-month absence which included him being suspended and undergoing rehabilitation processes. In the turn of events following his return and subsequently scoring in the 1-2 loss to Cape Town City on weekend, Zuma has been found to have transgressed the Club’s code of conduct. “As such, the midfielder will not be included in the squad for Tuesday’s match against Marumo Gallants and will be barred from participating in Club activities until the disciplinary process is concluded.” Zuma was suspended by Chiefs back in November after he was allegedly arrested for drunk driving. He returned to the first team squad recently, and scored a consolation goal for Chiefs in their 2-1 defeat to Cape Town City at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. = Kaizer Chiefs welcome Marumo Gallants at FNB Stadium on Tuesday night, 19:30 kickoff.
