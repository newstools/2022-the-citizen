Lions flanker Vincent Tshituka has been named the United Rugby Championship’s Player of the Month for April, becoming the first forward to receive this accolade this year. The talented loose forward received high praise from the South African rugby media as he beat off a number of strong contenders for the award, and which has intensified the calls for his inclusion in the Springbok squad should he become eligible. Tshituka is originally from the DRC. It was also revealed on Monday that the powerful flanker will play his rugby for the Sharks next season.  Tshituka was described as a player who “always gives his all” and who is “tireless on attack and defence, carrying the ball strongly and making several tackles”.
