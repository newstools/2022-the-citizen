According to the Western Cape Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo, the police officer had taken a suspect for medical attention when he went to check on an altercation taking place in another ward. The accused allegedly obtained the police officer’s firearm and shot the cop in the head before turning the gun on two patients. Nurses calmed the shooter before sedating him and recovering the firearm. Advocate Adenaan Gelderbloem said the state would oppose bail but the 39-year-old said he will abandon his bail application, according to a statement by the Western Cape National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila. No pictures of the accused are allowed to be taken as they still need to conduct an identity parade. “The state also advised the court that it is still waiting for the postmortem report, ballistic report and witness statements,” said Ntabazalila. His next court appearance will be on 30 June 2022, allowing for further investigations to take place. ALSO READ: 6 people gunned down in another Khayelitsha mass shooting
