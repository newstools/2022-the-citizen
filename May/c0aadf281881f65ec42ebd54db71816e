South Africa’s run in the singles competition at the French Open came to a crashing halt when lone contender Lloyd Harris fell at the first hurdle on Tuesday. Harris had been trailing in the second set on Monday when his match against French opponent Richard Gasquet was suspended overnight due to rain. Returning to the court on Tuesday afternoon, the 25-year-old South African put up a stronger fight against Gasquet, but he ultimately lost in straight sets.
