Zolati left everything behind him and spent four years walking, cycling and skateboarding his way through Africa, from Morocco to Cape Town, to bring the enchanting story of Africa and I to life. Speaking at the 30th Anniversary Pan African Film Festival (PAFF) in Los Angeles, Zolati said after seven years of hard work, his African dream became a reality. “This accomplishment will be a lifelong motivation enabling me to fulfil my future achievements. This is my very first award in the film industry, for which I, personally, am so grateful. Being here today, and after all that I have been through, is quite emotional for me. Reminiscing on how I started from scratch, as a 20-year-old boy from El Jadida, Morocco with a mere $80 in his pocket hoping to have his dream come true. Sitting here today, with an award under my belt, is a motivation to keep me to continue and never, ever give up,” he said.
