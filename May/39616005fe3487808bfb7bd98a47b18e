It is not clear at the moment how long the ban will be. But, according to Kwem’s agent, Johnny Ogbah, it will be lifted should they settle the R200 000 they owe.  “In this regard we wish to inform the parties that a ban from registering new players internationally has been implemented by Fifa as of today,” reads the letter from Fifa.  “Moreover, and in accordance with the aforementioned decision, the respondent’s member’s association is requested to immediately implement on the respondent, the club Chippa United FC, a ban from registering players at national level.” Speaking to SAfm’s Thabiso Mosia on Wednesday afternoon, Ogbah said: “We see this all the time in football. But the player doesn’t want the club to suffer and neither do I, so they just need to pay. If they make the payment now, then we will inform FIFA and the ban will be lifted immediately “I spoke to Simon (Chippa) again before going back to Fifa and he promised to pay the money on a certain date but no money has come. So we thought if we go to Fifa they will pay. Right now the ban says they can’t sign any players in the next transfer window.”  Marumo Gallants recently had their ban lifted, after they settled their debt with former player Gustavo Paez, who they chased out a few days after he signed, while the club was under its former name of Tshakhuma last season.
