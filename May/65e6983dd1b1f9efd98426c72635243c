Each leaving behind a family, a community, and a nation forever changed.” Biden’s announcement came as he chaired a global virtual Covid-19 summit, taking place as Europe also passed two million Covid-19 deaths, focused on efforts to bring the pandemic under control worldwide and prepare for future health emergencies.

By the next month, the virus was ravaging New York and the White House was predicting up to 240,000 deaths nationwide. Additional reporting by AFP
