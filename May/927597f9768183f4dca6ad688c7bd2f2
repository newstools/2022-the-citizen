The relative fortunes of the Golden Horse Sprint at Scottsville and the Gold Cup at Greyville over the past half century neatly sum up the seismic shifts in South Africa’s thoroughbred breeding industry. Back in the 1960s, the Gold Cup was widely regarded as the fourth biggest horse race in the country – after the July, Met and Summer. The Golden Horse was a new addition to the racing calendar, the very first sponsored race (by Gilbey’s Gin – and not a universally popular development) and barely attracting any attention from trainers outside Natal. Nowadays, the Gold Cup has been downgraded to a Grade 3 event due to the low quality of runners down the years, while the Golden Horse has raiders from far and wide and is among the five most prestigious sprints in the country. Thanks to the preponderance of sprint and mile races scheduled these days – which give owners quicker returns and allows horses to run more regularly thus hiking stake-winning opportunities – marathons like the Gold Cup have been elbowed to the sidelines. The entry list for the 2022 Golden Horse Sprint – to be raced on the first weekend of June – has 45 names, which according to Sporting Post’s research is the largest number in a decade. A date for EU veterinary officials to travel to South Africa to audit our African horse sickness containment regime has finally been set – an auspicious moment which many in the breeding industry believe will be a game changer. If the EU says local breeders can export horses directly to Europe without onerous quarantines, massive barriers to equine trade around the world will fall, many reckon. The big-money markets of the UK, the US, Japan, Australia and Europe tend to value long-distance races a little more than South Africa does, so one wonders whether we will see stamina blood seeping back into the local breeding sheds. One can only hope. Meanwhile, the prospect of speedy thrills in Maritzburg next week are compelling. Top trainer Sean Tarry has been talking up the chances of his charge Eden Roc, but the likes of Bard Of Avon, Bartholdi, Battle Force, Global Drummer, Real Gone Kid and Seeking the Stars won’t be giving him an inch up the tough Scottsville home stretch.
