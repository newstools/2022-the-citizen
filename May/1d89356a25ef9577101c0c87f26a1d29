A new Omicron variant found in wastewater is not necessarily dangerous and might not cause a fifth wave, according to an expert. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has detected a new sub-variant, called BA.4, of Omicron in wastewater in south western Johannesburg. This comes after a rise in new Covid-19 cases in South Africa, with 2,650 cases and seven deaths recorded on Monday. Speaking to 702 on Tuesday morning, executive director of NICD, Professor Adrian Puren, said they are currently conducting studies to determine the effectiveness of vaccines on the sub-variants. With the positive cases on the rise causing panic of a looming fifth wave, Puren said South Africa has not officially entered the fifth wave yet but is experiencing a resurgence.
