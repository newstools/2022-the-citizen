John Maduka and his technical team have very good job,” Mokwena said on SuperSportTV after the game. “But two, huge kudos to our team. We knew we had to battle today, we had to fight and grind and play with a lot of grit and tenacity and we did that. “We played the way the game was supposed to be played because the pitch was not very good and they were fresher. They ran, they closed us down, they chased us all over the pitch and forced us into a lot of mistakes. “But I think tactically we were excellent today, probably the best tactical performance of the season.”Sundowns will now meet Marumo Gallants in the final at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium on 28 May.
