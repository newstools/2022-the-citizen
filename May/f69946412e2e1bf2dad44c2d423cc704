Eskom warns of possible load shedding on Monday evening should there be any further generation unit breakdowns. The utility has advised citizens to use electricity wisely from 5am to 9am and 4pm to 10pm to ease the burden on the power stations. The utility said the power system has recovered and can meet demands during the day but added that the power is likely to be constrained during the evening which may lead to load shedding.

Eskom will service each generation unit at the Kusile and Kendal power stations before this evening.  If any of these stations fail to pick up again, short notice load shedding may be implemented.
