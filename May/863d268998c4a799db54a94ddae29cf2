VAAL BEST BET RACE 4 NO 1 QUEST FROM AFAR – WIN There is no such thing as a racing certainty but Quest From Afar is about as close as you are ever likely to get. This filly is at least 6.5kg better handicapped than any other runner in this race and that is obvious in the form. The Mike and Adam Azzie-trained filly is far better than anything else in this race and with S’manga Khumalo up, has to be the best bet on the card. VALUE BET RACE 7: QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT 5-MIDNIGHT GEM AND 6-BEQUEST WITH THE FIELD This is not an easy race but if collateral form works out, these two are expected to contest the finish. The full bet will cost R672 but again, one can take a percentage.
