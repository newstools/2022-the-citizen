Fans of musician turned businesswoman Rihanna have been left wondering if she is engaged after a scene in a recently released music video for her partner A$ap Rocky.The video is for the track “D.M.B.” which the pair have been filming visuals for since last July according to Complex. At one point in the video, Rocky can be seen flashing “Marry me?” as he smiles to flash his grill. Rihanna responds with “I do” on her own grills.  The fact that the video was written, directed, and executively produced by Rocky himself further convinced fans that they were witnessing an authentic proposal or even a wedding ceremony true to the nature of the two artists.  According to press material shared with the publication, in the video, the couple depicts the “true ride-or-die characters in a devoted relationship despite their circumstances.” According to TMZ, a source said the visual was simply for fun, and the two are not, in fact, engaged. After months of speculation, the couple confirmed their relationship in 2020. The announcement followed Rihanna’s confirmation of her split from Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel.
