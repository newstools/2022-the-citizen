The mini versions of foods are handmade by Ranjitji and Sanjay from food given to them by their father who is a farmer. All of the Mini Kitchen India videos are filmed at his at-home studio in Gujarat and earn him over $2,000 a month. He said: “It was not an easy road. “I could not afford to buy miniature cookware or a miniature stove when Sanjay suggested it to me. “But it did not discourage me – I worked hard and saved money to collect all the miniature kitchen parts I needed”. Ranjitji is thrilled with the positive reaction he received from his millions of worldwide viewers. He said: “It’s simply been amazing. “I have been able to have incredible sponsorships from some great brands. “Now, I make a living doing what I love and sharing it on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Youtube.”
