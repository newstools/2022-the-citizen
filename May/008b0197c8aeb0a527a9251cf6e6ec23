The SA sevens team, the Blitzboks, bounced back from their poor showing in Toulouse last week, with a relieving opening pool win against Argentina in the London World Rugby Sevens Series event on Saturday. Neil Powell’s men, no doubt after many harsh words were spoken this week, registered a 26-19 win against Argentina on Saturday morning. Dewald Human opened the scoring after some patient build-up play by the Boks, but it was soon 7-all when Argentina found a way through the South Africans’ defences. Muller du Plessis though quickly restored the seven-point buffer with a well-taken try from the restart and then straight after half-time the Blitzboks went 19-7 ahead when James Murphy scored. Argentina replied with a converted try to make it a five-point game and it was soon 19-all, the Blitzboks in danger of going down first-up in London. Angelo Davids though scored a crucial try almost immediately after entering the action, to the relief of Powell and the fans. Later on Saturday the Blitzboks face Ireland (2.22pm) and Kenya (5.08pm).
