Whispers going around that have reached the ears of the Mgosi Squad is that Mamelodi Sundowns’ coaching trio – Manqoba Mngqithi, Rulani Mokwena and Steve Komphela – are unsettled.

This is despite Sundowns being on course for a domestic treble this season. They have also broken records by winning five league titles in a row. “What is happening is that management are not happy with how easily the side was knocked out of the Champions League at the first real hurdle. You must remember that a lot of money was invested in the campaign. They had people scouting for the best facilities in every country they played in and that cost a lot of money.“You must also remember that they stayed for over a week at a world-class facility in Egypt which also cost a lot of money,” said a source. “I think they will have to explain what happened in their end-of-season technical report. Another thing that is unsettling is how new sporting director Flemming Berg is close to the club’s top management.”
