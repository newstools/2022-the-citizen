Michael Bucwa commonly known as Mr Smeg scored himself another national date, and this time the lovely lady he got to spoil was musical artist, Gigi Lamayne.  Taking to social media on 2 May, Mr Smeg expressed to the rapper that he loves her music, and thinks that she is extremely beautiful, and then requested to take her out on a date.  Shortly after Michael posted the tweet, the Koze Kube Nini hitmaker responded to the post with a video of herself, and a caption which said “sure let’s do it!”. Later that day, the two had set their ‘national date’ to take place on Sunday, 8 May, at DJ Shimza’s restaurant in Tembisa called The Hang Awt.
