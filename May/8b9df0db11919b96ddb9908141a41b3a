The Springboks will play their first Test in Adelaide when they line up against the Wallabies in the first of two Rugby Championship matches in Australia on 27 August, with their second encounter scheduled for the following week in New South Wales (venue to be confirmed). Rugby Australia confirmed the Boks’ destinations on Monday, while SA Rugby revealed that all six of the Boks’ home Tests this year would kick off at 5.05pm (SA time) – against Wales in the Incoming Series in July, as well as three Rugby Championship Tests in South Africa, against New Zealand at Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit and Ellis Park in Johannesburg and their final match of the series against Argentina at Kings Park in Durban. Kick-off times for both clashes against Australia, at the Adelaide Oval in South Australia and in NSW, must still be confirmed, while the Boks’ away match against Argentina in Buenos Aires on 17 September is scheduled to start at 9.10pm.

Nienaber also said the confirmation of the kick-off times for the Boks’ local Tests assisted tremendously with their planning. “Match days are very structured for us and every minute counts in ensuring that the players perform to their optimal ability when the starting whistle sounds, so the kick-off times allow us to fine-tune our planning even more as the countdown begins to the international season.” Springbok fixtures (SA times) Incoming Tour Saturday, 2 July (5.05pm) – Springboks v Wales, Pretoria Saturday, 9 July (5.05pm) – Springboks v Wales, Bloemfontein Saturday, 16 July (5.05pm) – Springboks v Wales, Cape Town Rugby Championship Saturday, 6 August (5.05pm) – Springboks v All Blacks, Nelspruit Saturday, 13 August (5.05pm) – Springboks v All Blacks, Johannesburg Saturday, 27 August (TBC) – Australia v Springboks, Adelaide Saturday, 3 September (TBC) – Australia v Springboks, New South Wales Saturday, 17 September (9.10pm) – Argentina v Springboks, Buenos Aires Saturday, 24 September (5.05pm) – Springboks v Argentina, Durban
