KENILWORTH BEST BET RACE 1: SWINGER: NO 6 NOT IN DOUBT AND NO 9 STRATOSPHERIC Let’s try to get off to a winning start and build up a kitty for the rest of this 10-race card. These two runners look the ones to fight it out and are expected to finish in the top three. VALUE BET RACE 3: QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT NO 2 BOWLED OVER AND NO 12 WAR BANNER WITH THE FIELD  We had great success with a Quartet in Race 4 at the Vaal yesterday where it paid R8016.50. For an outlay of R158.40 one would have got a return of R801.60. It also proved that one must double float with the field because the second-placed horse had no decent form and paid R12.60 for a place. Anton Marcus rides Bowled Over for his nephew, Adam Marcus, and this looks the runner to beat. War Banner sees Richard Fourie riding for Eric Sands and this gelding showed major improvement in his last start. The full cost of this bet is R1320 but once again, one can take a percentage, even as low as 1% for R13.20.
