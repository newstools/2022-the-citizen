Head coach Etienne Fynn has named a number of United Rugby Championship players, who haven’t received much game time in that competition, in the Sharks team for their Currie Cup clash against the Pumas in Durban on Friday night, and their experience will no doubt bolster the side in the run-in to the playoffs. Hooker Kerron van Vuuren replaces Fez Mbatha while Ruben van Heerden comes in for Emile van Heerden in the second row where he restores his partnership with Hyron Andrews. Jeandre Labuschange is in for Dylan Richardson and Sikhumbuzo Notshe takes over from Celimpilo Gumede at eighthman, completing the changes among the forwards.

In the final change to the starting line-up, recently signed Varsity Cup backline star Nevaldo Fleurs plays at fullback. With their previous match against the Blue Bulls having been cancelled following recent flooding that devastated KwaZulu-Natal, it has been a month since the Sharks’ last Currie Cup game, a tough 13-6 away win against Griquas on 6 April. With two log points granted to both sides in the cancelled match against the Bulls, the Sharks currently occupy third spot on the log with 24 points, nine clear of the Pumas.
