South African aircraft maker Sling Aircraft has jumped on chance to star in their own trailer ahead of the release of the upcoming movie Top Gun: Maverick. Pitman and Blyth from Sling Aircraft created their own two-minute Hollywood “blockbuster trailer”, centred on Top Gun: Maverick at the end of May 2022. In Top Gun Slinger, Pitman and Blyth showcase some familiar scenes from the original Top Gun blockbuster which was released over 30 years ago.  One iconic scene of Tom Cruise chasing down an aircraft on his motorcycle has been recreated by the South African duo on a bicycle. It is not the first debut of the duo who have previously had YouTube success with another of popular videos, titled Around the World in 40 Days, which sees the airplane daredevils travelling the world in a light aircraft designed by themselves at Sling Aircraft. In 2009, the original yellow Sling 2 (known as ZU-TAF) flew Pitman and Blyth around the world on a 40-day, 45 000km journey. Top Gun: Maverick is a 2022 American action drama and sequel to the original Top Gun released in 1986. Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer reprise their roles from the first film.
