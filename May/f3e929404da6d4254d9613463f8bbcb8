For years, beauty and skincare fanatics across the continent who did not have the option to travel abroad or ask family members to send them Fenty cosmetics have been left longing to experience Rihanna’s first baby and now, we will finally get to find out if they truly are worth the hype.Musician, businesswoman and expectant mom Rihanna took to Instagram on Tuesday to announce that Fenty is coming to Africa. “I’ve been waiting for this moment!! @fentybeauty & @fentyskin are finally dropping in AFRICA!!! “Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe…we comin’ at ya May 27th and that’s just the beginning,” she posted, much to the delight of her legion of fans living in the regions she listed.  Fenty Beauty is a cosmetics brand that was launched in September 2017 by Rihanna. The brand was immediately hailed for its broad inclusivity catering to more skin tones than other brands with its signature Pro Filt’R foundation.  The original foundation launch included 40 shades and has since expanded to 50. The brand also made sure to use a range of models from different ethnic backgrounds and genders to illustrate how their product looked on different people.  Over the years, the product range has expanded to include countless products as well as a skincare line.  Though Fenty Beauty credits Rihanna as its CEO, the company falls under the LVMH luxury brand umbrella.  Fenty Beauty was, and still is available on Takealot, however, those looking to purchase the products have wondered if the online retailer is an accredited Fenty retailer. Additionally, many have complained about the exorbitant prices. Almost triple the price in America.
