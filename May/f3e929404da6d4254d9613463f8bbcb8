The brand was immediately hailed for its broad inclusivity catering to more skin tones than other brands with its signature Pro Filt’R foundation.  The original foundation launch included 40 shades and has since expanded to 50. The brand also made sure to use a range of models from different ethnic backgrounds and genders to illustrate how their product looked on different people.  Over the years, the product range has expanded to include countless products as well as a skincare line.  Though Fenty Beauty credits Rihanna as its CEO, the company falls under the LVMH luxury brand umbrella.  Fenty Beauty was, and still is available on Takealot, however, those looking to purchase the products have wondered if the online retailer is an accredited Fenty retailer. Additionally, many have complained about the exorbitant prices.
