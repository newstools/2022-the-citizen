Creating a dataset that has the greatest genomic diversity.”  He said it can enable “rapid discoveries that have long-term implications for cancer research, drug development, and patient care, not just in Africa, but globally”. The company intends to use expansive datasets coupled with immunogenomics, bioinformatics, and deep learning to “rapidly accelerate advancements in oncology”. The endeavour is strengthened through Yemaachi’s already-formed clinical partnerships and the “breadth of expertise of the highly talented founding team”, managing partner Tobi Oke said.
