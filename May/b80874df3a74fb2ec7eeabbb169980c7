Mamelodi Sundowns are said to be facing a conundrum on some of the players that they sent out on loan this season, hoping they would get game time and get better. A source says Sundowns are now even considering releasing some of them when they come back from their loan spells.  “The main problem is the two who are at Swallows (Grant Margerman and who were given game time but didn’t make full use of it. They had spent a season with Sundowns before they were loaned out and were expected to show that they want to return and break into the team.

But they want him back so he can learn from the likes of (Andile) Jali and grow within the team.  “But you must remember that there are still the likes of (Siphelele) Mkhulise also waiting ahead of him,” added the source.
