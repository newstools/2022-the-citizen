According to a News24 report, Jantjies was involved in an incident at a toilet cubicle.

InTouchSports said in a statement: “While on board the plane, a light was damaged.” They added: “We believe the incident has been unnecessarily heightened.” It is known that Jantjies was arrested on arrival in Joburg on Sunday morning for causing “malicious damage to property”.
