Demi Lee Moore and her fiancé, Barthlo, met in 2013 at MusiekWêreld, the guitar shop where he was working at the time. She bought her guitar there and after snapping a string, she took it in and spotted him in the shop, wearing red All Stars. “I hadn’t worn mine in years but happened to decide to wear my pink All Stars that day.” Clearly, it was meant to be. After attending one of Barthlo’s shows, the two went for coffee and as they say, the rest is history. Barthlo Visagie is known for his part in the Battle of the Bands band, The Vanilla, and has been seen performing with artists like Jack Parrow.
