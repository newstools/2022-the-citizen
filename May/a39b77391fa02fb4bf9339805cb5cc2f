A nomenclature first rumoured two years ago, Honda has revealed the all-new ZR-V in China, while also confirming European availability from next year.   Although showcased in concept form at the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show last year as a compact RS Concept based on the underpinnings of the new BR-V, the ZR-V is radically different in that it slots in above HR-V and below the CR-V while still providing seating for five. The most confusing aspect though is that the ZR-V will go on sale later this year in North America as the HR-V, despite being completely unrelated to the European model known as the Vezel Japan.

Set to be built by GAC-Honda, the ZR-V is expected to derive motivation from a normally aspirated 2.0-litre petrol or the familiar 1.5-litre turbo, with drive going to the front wheels only via a CVT. While details surrounding the North American HR-V are unknown at present, the ZR-V, in European form, is anticipated to make use of the e: HEV powertrain used in the HR-V and Fit. The confusion surrounding the nameplate’s use is likely to intensify if the concept shown in Indonesia is approved for production. It would result in the ZR-V name being used on two completely different vehicles, with the same applying to the HR-V designation. In addition, the concept ZR-V slots-in below the HR-V/Vezel as Honda’s smallest model, a position it will soon occupy in other markets once supply of the WR-V runs-out. Tipped for production in India, the compact ZR-V is likely to present a better prospect for South Africa than the Chinese model. However, it still needs to be approved for production rumoured to happen in 2023.
