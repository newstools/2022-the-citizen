Family man and Springbok rugby captain, Siya Kolisi melted the hearts of his fans and followers after sharing a video on social media of himself spending some adorable quality time with his daughter. In the video, the rugby captain was caught sitting in the middle of the living room carpet with his 5-year-old daughter Keziah, spending some quality time and playing with her dolls and doll set. While Kolisi was brushing the one doll’s hair with a tiny baby pink comb, Keziah was dressing the other doll in a fashionable outfit, before adding red lipstick to the doll to complete her look.  Siyabonga played in the background of the adorable video, but the song was cut short to allow for his fans and followers to hear the conversation he shared with his daughter. When the father-of-two asked Keziah how she felt about the way he brushed the doll’s hair, Keziah quickly changed the topic by expressing that she loved the doll’s dress.
