BEST BET RACE 6 NO 3 GOING UP – WIN Candice Bass-Robinson saddles this highly regarded filly in a the Listed Stormsvlei Stakes over 1800m and she just has five rivals to beat. This will be her first attempt at running over 1800m but if reports are accurate, she is looking for this trip.  It is also worth taking some Swingers with No 4 Peut Etre Moi. VALUE BET RACE 8: QUARTET – DOUBLE FLOAT NO 7 REWRITE THE STARS AND NO 10 HAMMIE’S FAN Both of these horses are at a good price and this Quartet should pay well if we can catch it. However, both runners have been consistent and are expected to run well.    There is one scratching at this stage in this race which leaves 10 runners. The full cost of this bet is R672, but one can take 10% for R67.20.
