FAIRVIEW POLYTRACK BEST BET RACE 2 SWINGER: 2-SAILAWAY WITH ME AND 4-BABYITSCOLDOUTSIDE Leading apprentice Rachel Venniker is in Port Elizabeth today and she has some decent rides for leading trainer Alan Greeff. Sailaway With Me is undoubtedly one of her better opportunities. Warren Kennedy rides Babyitscoldoutside for the other top Port Elizabeth trainer, Gavin Snaith, and these two look likely to fight out the race. VALUE BET RACE 7: QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT NO 1-FRANCA AND NO 3-GLACIER GOLD WITH THE FIELD Glacier Gold has won her last three on the turf but was also won on the Polytrack. Her stable companion, Franca, has finished behind her on a couple of occasions on the turf but this filly is better on the Polytrack and will improve on those last few performances.  In fact, her record on the course is two wins and a second place from three starts. Rachel Venniker rides Glacier Gold while Richard Fourie rides Franca.
