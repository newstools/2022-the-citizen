Eskom has announced that it will implement stage 2 load shedding from 5pm on Tuesday afternoon until 5am next week Monday. The power utility said this was due to a shortage of generation capacity. “This load shedding has been caused by a shortage of generation capacity owing to delays in returning generators to service, as well as breakdowns of nine generators. Eskom will continue to monitor the system and implement any changes as required,” Eskom said in a statement. According to the power utility, since Monday, a generation unit each at Lethabo, Tutuka, Ingula, Drakensberg, Arnot as well as two units each at Hendrina and Matla power stations suffered breakdowns.

We also expect to rely on the use of emergency generating reserves to limit the stage of load shedding during this period.” Eskom said it currently had 3 875MW on planned maintenance, while another 15 067MW of capacity was unavailable due to breakdowns. “Eskom would again like to remind the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. “We, therefore, request the public to continue using electricity sparingly to reduce the occurrence of load shedding.” NOW READ: No more load shedding – This suburb is ready to give Eskom the boot
