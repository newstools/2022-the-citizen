Owners of former GladAfrica Championship side TS Sporting are looking to buy their way back to the league after they were relegated this season. Sporting’s relegation – together with Jomo Cosmos – was confirmed last weekend with a game to spare.  But Phakaaathi has learnt that they are looking at buying their way back with Limpopo’s Platinum City Rovers their main target for now. Sources have claimed that Rovers are facing financial difficulties and their players were sometimes not paid on time which is why Oupa Manyisa left before they played their last game.

But another source said the owners of Rovers are not so keen on selling their status and have refuted the claims that they are facing financial difficulties.
