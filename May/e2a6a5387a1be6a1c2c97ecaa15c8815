SA Lottery operator Ithuba confirmed one lucky player is R40 million richer today after bagging Saturday’s Lotto Jackpot. The player matched all six numbers for the R39,912,562.40 jackpot, while three other players matched five numbers and the bonus ball for a payout of R32,357,70 each. One player matched five numbers and the bonus ball for the Lotto Plus Two jackpot – a R165,131.20 payout. Congratulations! The next Lotto draw on 4 May will kick off the new cycle with an R3 million jackpot.  Since the Lotto Plus jackpot went unclaimed, it rolled over to R24 million for Plus 1, while Plus 2 rolled over to R4 million. Get your tickets before the cutoff on Wednesday. Lottery outlets close at 8.30 pm on the day of a draw, which happens at 9 pm. Lotto entries cost R5 per board, and you’ll have to fork out an additional R2.50 per board for Lotto Plus. Buy your tickets from participating outlets or www.nationallottery.co.za. In March, a Limpopo resident won a life-changing R55 million Powerball Jackpot after spending only R15 on a quick pick ticket. At the time, Ithuba CEO Charmaine Mabuza said it is “wonderful to witness how people’s dreams come true through our life-changing jackpots”. If you should be so lucky to snatch the jackpot, Ithuba will offer financial advice and trauma counselling at no cost to the winner.  This is done to help the winner adjust to their new lifestyle.
