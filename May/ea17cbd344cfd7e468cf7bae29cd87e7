VAAL CLASSIC BEST BET RACE 6 SWINGER: NO 4 DEFENDER OF RIGHTS AND NO 11 SILLY FELLA This is not an easy card to negotiate but Defender Of Rights looks one of the better bets on the card with Silly Fella the main danger. The Swinger looks the safe bet in this race. VALUE BET RACE 4 QUARTET: DOULE FLOAT No 2-IMPOSING ANGEL AND No 3-INSATIABLE WITH THE FIELD This is a lovely race to catch the Quartet as it really looks likely to produce a nice payout if one gets it right. Imposing Angel teams up the in-form trainer-jockey combination of Paul Peter and Warren Kennedy while Insatiable is from the Johan Janse van Vuuren yard and will be ridden by Keagan de Melo. One must include the field because anything could run into the placings in this field. One can take 10% which will cost R158.40 and if you get it right, you will make a nice profit. One can even take 1% or 2% for R15.90 or R31.80.
