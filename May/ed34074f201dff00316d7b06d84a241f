Matthew Mott was Wednesday named as head coach of England’s men’s white-ball teams on a four-year contract. The 48-year-old has been in charge of Australia’s all-conquering women’s team for the past seven years, winning back-to-back Twenty20 World Cups in 2018 and 2020 and the 50-over equivalent earlier this year. He also guided Australia’s women to a record 26 successive one-day international wins and their recent victory over England in the multi-format Ashes series.

England now have separate head coaches in red and white-ball cricket for the first time since 2014, with former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum announced last week as their Test match chief. Mott, who has previously worked in the English game with county side Glamorgan, is expected to begin his reign with three one-day internationals away to the Netherlands next month. ALSO READ: Broad and Anderson back in England team “It was always going to take something special to leave the role that I have loved for the past seven years with the Australian women’s team,” Mott said in an England and Wales Cricket Board statement. “However, I genuinely believe that the time is right to play a role in helping the England men’s ODI (one-day international) and T20 group continue to evolve as one of the best teams in the world. “The idea of the split roles and the chance to work alongside Brendon McCullum in his red-ball role is an opportunity that I am incredibly enthusiastic about.” England’s new managing director of men’s cricket Rob Key said: “I’m confident that, in (captain) Eoin Morgan and Matthew Mott, we have a formidable partnership that can push for more trophies in the coming years.”
