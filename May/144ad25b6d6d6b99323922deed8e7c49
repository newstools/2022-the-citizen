Marumo Gallants will immediately be allowed to sign new players, the Limpopo based club have announced. This comes after Fifa lifted the ban imposed on the club some two years ago.  “The ban on registering new players was imposed on the club following a dispute related to Venezuelan player Gustavo Paez. The club had failed to compensate the striker for prematurely terminating his contract in 2020, shortly after he had signed with Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila Football Club (TTM FC), which later became the current Marumo Gallants FC.

After lengthy discussions, Marumo Gallants and Paez reached a settlement agreement, resulting in the lifting of the ban, which was officially confirmed in a letter to the club issued by Fifa this week.”  Marumo chairman Abram Sello expressed his relief at the matter coming to a favourable ending.  “We are relieved that the matter has been amicably resolved and that we will be able to plan for the next season”.
