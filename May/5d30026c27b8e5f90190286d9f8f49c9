Springbok coach Jacques Nienaber has given his series of alignment camps the thumbs up ahead of the international season. The latest camp concluded in Cape Town on Thursday. The Bok management team previously held a camp in Durban and also met with several overseas-based players in Europe. The world champions kick off their 2022 season with three Tests against Wales in July. After that they’ll again play in the Rugby Championship, against Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. “We are satisfied with the alignment camps, and we believe these sessions will be beneficial to ensure a smooth return to the training field before the three Tests against Wales,” said Nienaber.
