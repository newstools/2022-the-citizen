The upwards trajectory in South Africa’s new vehicle sales continued into April with a fourth straight increase in as many months. Although the Toyota Hilux kept its position as the country’s best-selling vehicle with sales of 2,788 units, the biggest surprise came in the form of the Suzuki Swift, whose 1,621 placed it second ahead of the Volkswagen Polo Vivo (1,547) and the Toyota Corolla Cross (1,421). After a few months out of the top 10, the Ford Ranger re-entered the “1 000 club” with its 1,140, placing sixth behind the Volkswagen Polo (1,320), and ahead of the Toyota HiAce (1,126), Nissan NP200 (966), Renault Kiger (931) and its other great rival, the Isuzu D-Max (777). Despite the effects of not only the floods in KwaZulu-Natal, but also the ongoing war in the Ukraine, the global semi-conductor shortage and succession of public holidays, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA) recorded total sales of 37,107 units, an increase of 4.3% from the 35,591 moved last year. The comparatively low figures reflected throughout the various segments with only new passenger vehicles finishing the month on a positive note; an increase of 12.9% from 22,729 to 26,653. Hardest hit, light commercial vehicles dropped 11.9% from 10,849 to 9,558, with medium duty commercials contracting by 4.6% from 543 to 475, and heavy duty commercial vehicles by 9.4% from 1,915 to 1,421.

Placing fourth was Hyundai on 2,820, with Renault taking fifth (2,400), Nissan sixth (2,148), Kia seventh (2,019), Ford eighth (1,956), Haval ninth (1,393) and Isuzu tenth (830).
