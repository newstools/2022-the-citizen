She looked sleek in a pink Guess one-piece swimsuit as they indulged in the gorgeous Mauritian sunsets. For her last performance, she wore what she calls her 100s and 1000s dress by Salomie du Plooy.  “I felt like after performing on stage, I could make an appearance on an ice rink,” she said in the post-Mauritius post. We are back safely. Now I am going to kiss and hug my kids!”
