When seeking to make the perfect eisbein, the first step is to get the correct piece of meat from the pig’s leg which is neither the ham nor the ankle, but the piece in-between.  Another secret to creating an amazing smoked and glazed eisbein is to ensure that you give the meat enough time to cook thoroughly to produce a tender eisbein which has soft skin which will later be crisped by the delicious glaze. We have also added a garlic butter roast potatoes recipe which goes exceptionally well as a side dish that is accompanied by your eisbein.
