Before the American model revealed that she was pregnant with her first child, Gigi Hadid took the internet by storm when she shared her favourite spicy vodka pasta recipe via her Instagram story which soon went viral. When she recreated her pasta for her fans and followers, she noted that she did not have vodka in her home, so she would not be using it.  The other ingredients which she was out of were scallops, so she substituted them with a small red onion, and basil for garnish, which she swapped out for tomato and basil-flavoured tomato paste.
