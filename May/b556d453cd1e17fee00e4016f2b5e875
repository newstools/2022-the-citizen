The United Ulama Council of South Africa (UUCSA) has confirmed that the moon signalling the end of the blessed month of Ramadan has not been sighted in South Africa.  Therefore, Muslims across South Africa will be celebrating Eid-ul-Fitr, which culminates the end of the Islamic month of Ramadan, on Tuesday.  The announcement was made by UUCSA Secretary General Moulana Ebrahim on Sunday.  With Eid now big on Tuesday, Muslims will have to keep one more fast on Monday.  Muslims also have to dispense of  Sadaqatul fitr, a compulsory charity which becomes payable on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. Fitr means to break fast or to refrain from fasting.  Hence the Eid after the fasts of Ramadhân is called Eid-ul-Fitr, as it is the day of rejoicing after the completion of fasting.  On this occasion of happiness, as a sign of gratitude one has to give a specific amount in aims, which is called Sad’qatui-Fitr.  To purify and obtain complete blessings for the fasts of Ramadhân Mubârak one has to give Sadaqatul-Fitr.  Thus it is wâjib or compulsory to give Sadaqatul-Fitr to purify one’s fast.  The true object in giving Sadqatul-fitr on this happy, occasion is also to assist the poor and needy, so that, they may rejoice with the more fortunate. The day of Eid usually starts with the early morning prayer known as Fajr.  Muslims then proceed to the Eidgah, or Eid prayer, where hundreds of Muslims in various areas across the country gather to offer the two-part prayer.  While it’s not custom, many Muslims also visit the cemetery to pay their respects to their loved ones who have passed on.  The rest of the day of Eid is spent visiting family, friends and being in the company of loved ones.  Muslims are also not allowed to fast on the day of Eid.
