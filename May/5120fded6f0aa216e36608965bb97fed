Bismarck du Plessis will return to action after serving a three-week ban when the Bulls host the Lions in a Currie Cup match at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday. The 37-year-old will line up alongside Lizo Gqoboka, who will also captain the team, at loosehead prop and Dylan Smith, who gets his first start in the blue jersey, at tighthead prop. Juan Mostert will earn his first start for the Bulls, earning a spot at flyhalf in an exciting backline which will also see Kabelo Mokoena, who was part of the successful Tuks team that recently claimed the Varsity Cup title, run out in the blue jersey.
