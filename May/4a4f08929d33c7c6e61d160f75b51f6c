Considered one of the golden years in South African soapies, Generations on SABC 1 created many memorable careers and moments which included Ntombi (Sonia Mbele) and Karabo’s (Connie Ferguson) bitter rivalry.  Connie’s daughter Lesedi Matsunyane-Ferguson shared insight on why she wanted to reignite this TV debate of Ntombi’s and Karabo’s most iconic moment, the slap.  Lesedi shared a snippet of her mom and Sonia getting into a fight in character in one of the episodes in Generations in the early 2000s.  The old clip went viral on Tik To a few weeks ago with neticitizens saying soapies back then had a different type of drama, and Ntombi vs Karabo was unmatched on television.  A friend asked Lesedi to record Connie reacting to the clip. The actress is seen laughing at the scene of “the slap” and wondered how they found the video. Connie also commented the hair in the scene is very much her own “that wasn’t a weave, it was my own hair”, adding their slaps were real and they didn’t fake it.  The Ferguson family celebrated late Shona Ferguson’s birthday on Saturday who would have turned 48 years old.
