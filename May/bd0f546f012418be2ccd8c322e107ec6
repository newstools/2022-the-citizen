Sibusiso Vilakazi is rumoured to be among the top players that Mamelodi Sundowns are considering releasing at the end of the current campaign. A source has claimed that a number of players have reached the end of their circle at Masandawana and could be released including some who are fan favourites.  “Vila is unfortunately in that group of players who have reached the end of their circle. Sundowns sign players based on five-year circles. Some are allowed to go above the five year circle if the team still needs them. “It is tricky to release them because you find that some of them are still popular among the supporters when they reach the end of their circle,” said a source.  READ ALSO: Mashiane set for Chiefs exit?
