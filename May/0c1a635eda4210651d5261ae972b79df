Media personality and fashionista Bonang Matheba lived up to her reputation of shutting down red carpets at the Africa Magic Viewers’ Choice Awards (AMVCA’s).  From her last appearance on the red carpet at the Real Housewives of Lagos premiere in Johannesburg, it was clear at the AMVCA’s in Lagos, Nigeria on Saturday – Bonang wanted to bring out her best.  Taking inspiration from Nigeria’s exquisite and over the top sense of style, Bonang played host with Ik Osakioduwa at the awards show as she stunned with four looks.  The first dress was by Nigerian designer Sheyeladejo, it was a glitzy pink and diamante gown with feather details on top.  The second look was a blue one-shoulder dress by House of Dova, styled with an equally breathtaking jewellery necklace by Jewellery Affair.  Bringing more colour in an orange 2207 ruffle dress, with matching see-through gloves for her third look.
