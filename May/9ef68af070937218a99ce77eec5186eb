He is currently unattached to any clubs after his recent stint with Chippa ended badly. The veteran coach was recently at Manchester City where he was hoping to learn a few tricks from England’s best team at the moment. “He is not in a hurry for a new job. He has had a few clubs coming to ask about his availability but he is not too keen. He wants a club that will need him and allow him to work in his own way by bringing the kind of players that he wants,” said a source. “I heard that even Simba SC of Tanzania have made enquiries about him recently and that could be where he goes if they reach an agreement on working conditions.”
