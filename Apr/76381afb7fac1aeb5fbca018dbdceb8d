He said he didn’t even want to talk about Kaizer Chiefs.  He also questioned Chiefs decision to sign Siyethemba Sithebe, suggesting that he is not quality enough to play for the Naturena side.  Speaking in IsiZulu, Zongo said: “Khona abanye abanama-dreads, badlala kuMaZulu bagqoka onamba 10.

How did that happen?
