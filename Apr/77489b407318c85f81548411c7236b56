Goals, goals, goals Kaizer Chiefs went into this weekend’s matches with the worst scoring record in the DStv Premiership’s top five, hitting the back of the net just 27 times in 23 league matches. Amakhosi have drawn a blank in six of their last ten matches in all competitions, including the Nedbank Cup exit at the hands of TS Galaxy.  Amakhosi’s top scorer in the league, Keagan Dolly, with seven goals is a left winger, while Khama Billiat is their top striker with six. Zwane and Sheppard need to get far more out of attacking talent like Samir Nurkovic and Lebo Manyama if they are to make a success of their season.  Solve the Ngcobo conundrum Nkosingiphile Ngcobo was a standout performer for Chiefs last season in a disappointing Premiership campaign, but was underused by Stuart Baxter in his time at the club.  Ngcobo made just five starts in the league for Chiefs under Baxter, and this despite goals in December in wins over Maritzburg United and Sekhukhune United. If Zwane and Sheppard can find room for Ngcobo in their side, they could unlock more potency for Chiefs going forward.  Settle on a goalkeeper Brandon Petersen has made seven appearances for Chiefs in the Premiership this season, Daniel Akpeyi has made 12 and Bruce Bvuma has made four. It goes without saying that it might help Chiefs, though their defence has not been too bad this season, to have a permanent man between the sticks.  The anomaly here is Itumeleng Khune, who at his peak is the best Chiefs goalkeeper in the squad, but who hasn’t been at his peak for some time. Do Chiefs throw Khune back into the fray, with the side needing leaders in another time of struggle?
