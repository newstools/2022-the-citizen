I am humbled to be here,” said Mathibe.  “When I was here before I was a player and I enjoyed myself. Now it is another chapter. Being a coach is different from being a player. I am looking forward to working with the keepers here at Chiefs.  “I think I will give them what I have learnt in the 21 years of my football career. I am looking forward to it.” Mathibe will also be responsible for scouting goalkeepers and he says it will not be an easy task.   “I don’t think it will be easy for me, but it is good for me to look for the talent here in South Africa because we have been having a problem of goalkeepers in  the past 10 years especially for Bafana Bafana. I was a goalkeeper before and with hard work I will get what is expected of me.”  On Working with Lee Baxter, he said: “I am happy to work with him because he has international experience. He will also learn from me South African things and I will learn from him.”
