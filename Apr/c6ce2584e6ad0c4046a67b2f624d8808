Iran’s supreme leader will pardon or commute the jail sentences of 1,542 convicted prisoners in a gesture marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, his website said Saturday. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei “agreed to pardon or commute the sentences of 1,542 convicts” for the Eid al-Fitr holiday that marks the end of the holy month, it said. The supreme leader routinely grants collective pardons on major religious holidays, in coordination with the head of the judiciary. Eid al-Fitr starts on Monday in Iran. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia announced that the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, will begin on Monday in the country. “Monday… is the first day of the blessed Eid al-Fitr for this year,” with Sunday the last day of Ramadan, the official Saudi Press Agency said Saturday, citing a royal court statement. Fellow Gulf states the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain have also made the same announcement. The timing of Eid is determined by the sighting of the crescent moon, in accordance with the Muslim lunar calendar. The holiday is normally celebrated by families gathering together.
