Following yet another domestic Premier Soccer League triumph, the Bulls sent out a congratulatory message to their Tshwane brothers, Mamelodi Sundowns, on winning their fifth consecutive league title. Going into the mid-week PSL matches, Sundowns needed only one point to retain their status as South African champions and they did just that on Wednesday night when they played to a 0-0 draw at home at Loftus Versfeld against Cape Town City. The Bulls joined the many Amasandawana faithful in celebration of this historic feat. “The Bulls are extremely proud and celebrate the unmatched achievement of our brothers, Mamelodi Sundowns,” said Blue Bulls Company CEO, Edgar Rathbone. “It is only befitting that the teams that call Loftus Versfeld and Tshwane their home remain the reigning champions in their respective sporting codes and competitions. We also have the Bulls Under-20 side that was recently crowned SA Rugby U20 Cup champions. “With this remarkable title victory, Mamelodi Sundowns are the perfect motivation for the Bulls to reach for greater heights too in the race to claim a third consecutive Currie Cup title as well as our efforts to go as far as possible in our first season of the United Rugby Championship which is close to the business end now. “We would like to congratulate Mamelodi Sundowns chairman, Tlhopie Motsepe, co-coaches Manqoba Mnqithi, Steve Khompela and Rhulani Mokwena, the players, staff and supporters of the great club for this magnificent achievement and reinforcing Loftus Versfeld as the Home of Champions,” read the Bulls statement.
