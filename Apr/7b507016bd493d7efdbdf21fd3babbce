BEST BET RACE 1: SWINGER: 1 DIVINE DYNASTY AND 2 AGA HEAT These two runners should fight out the finish of this race and the Swinger looks an outstanding bet. One could also be brave and take the Exactas, 1 x 2 and 2 x 1. VALUE BET RACE 7: NO 11 SILLY FELLA – EACHWAY Jockey S’manga Khumalo is in excellent form currently and when he is riding off a light weight, he is worth following. This is the case with Silly Fella who will have just 54kg on his back. Khumalo has only ridden him once and that resulted in a win. Hopefully he cam make it two from two.
