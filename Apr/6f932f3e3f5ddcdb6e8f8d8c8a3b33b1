If this post-divorce body glow that Minnie Dlamini is serving us is what separation looks like, then sign us up.  A picture of the TV presenter “broke the internet” this week as Minnie appears in a sultry look she posted on Instagram.  She is wearing black underwear, a crop white collar shirt, her hair styled to look wet and black stiletto heels.  Minnie captioned the stunning look with a song lyric: “Some people feel the rain. Others just get wet.” – Bob Marley.  The Homeground presenter’s comment section was filled with people complimenting how amazing she looked, including many celebs such as Anele Mdoda, former Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi, actress Khanyi Mbau and “Shauwn “Mamkhize” Mkhize. Minnie received much love and praise, particularly as people want to see the media personality do well as she is in the process of divorcing her husband Quinton Jones. Minnie has expressed that this has been a difficult period in her life, as the former couple has a son together  Netha Makhosini Jones.   She also wrote on Twitter after Riky Rik’s death by suicide, that this could have been her too.  She tweeted: “I won’t tell a word of a lie I am broken!!! Today’s news could’ve easily been me.”  The Joneses announced their separation to the surprise of many people in February.  Strangely there was a backlash directed at Minnie, as people unashamedly criticised her for the separation, dismissing her looks and arguing she isn’t much of a “catch” anymore.  The sultry picture also drew critique, as some netcitizens argued the snap didn’t look like her and that she was “trying too hard.” There were also questions if the star had lost weight in a short space of time because of the differences in appearance in some pictures on her social media accounts just a few weeks ago.  As much as there was hate, Minnie Dlamini’s picture did receive lots of love too.  She is set to host the return of Standard Banks “Joburg Polo in The Park” event at Steyn City next weekend,
