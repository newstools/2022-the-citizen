It was an emotional day of farewells and surprises on Saturday, as the SA Senior Track and Field Championships came to a close at Green Point Stadium in Cape Town. Farewell Wenda It wasn’t the fairytale ending she might have wanted, but Wenda Nel was clearly overwhelmed with emotion after grabbing the silver medal in the women’s 400m hurdles final. The 33-year-old Commonwealth Games bronze medallist, aiming for her 10th national title before she retires at the end of the season took second place in 56.08 seconds. Though rising star Zeney van der Walt won gold in 55.75, Nel received an ovation from the crowd before entering a huddle with her opponents and joining them in a group wave. “It’s a bittter-sweet feeling. I wanted the 10th title but I knew it would be a tough one. I’m very emotional and extremely happy.” Less fanfare Like Nel, race walker Wayne Snyman probably made his last appearance at the national championships. Unlike Nel, he did it in a near empty stadium in the men’s 20km walk, which was held in the morning session. Snyman completed the race in 1:28:46 to secure his sixth SA title in the event, as the 37-year-old school teacher gears up for his final campaign on the international circuit. Munyai stunned National record holder Clarence Munyai entered the blocks as the firm favourite in the men’s 200m final after dominating the preliminary rounds and showing fine form this season. He was beaten to the line, however, by 20-year-old Sinesipho Dambile, who won in 20.55, with Munyai settling for second place in 20.63, in one of the biggest upsets of the domestic showpiece. Semenya sets pace Three-time 800m world champion Caster Semenya, who had finished second in the women’s 5 000m final two days earlier, turned out in her first 10 000m race. But she didn’t finish. Setting the pace for training partner Glenrose Xaba, Semenya pulled out at the 6 000m mark, and Xaba went on to win gold in 32:31.49.
