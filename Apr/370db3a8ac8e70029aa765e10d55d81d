Royal AM striker and the PSL’s Player of the Month for February and March, Mxolisi Macuphu has hinted at a rift between him and former side TS Galaxy coach as being the cause of his sudden departure from the Mpumalanga club. Macuphu made a surprise move to MaMkhize Boys in January when it looked like Galaxy needed him more because they were fighting relegation.

But he did tell me that some European coaches come here and feed players nonsense and when they are questioned, they become agitated and the player who asks too much gets sidelined for no reason,” said the source.
