Rugby fans love putting “invitation” teams together. You’ve heard of the “best XV of the World Cup” or “best Bok side ever”, but never before has there been a “best animal XV”. Until now. It is not known where or how the “game” started, but rugby fans on social media have had a field day putting together their best and strongest teams. It has resulted in fans on Twitter sharing their XVs and bragging about who’d outdo who, and who best to pick in what positions. The hippo, rhino, giraffe and cheetah are popular choices, but, understandably, there is no place for the tortoise. While the Springbok gets a look in, and so too, the lion and leopard, there is no place for a shark or bull. Former 1995 Springbok World Cup-winning lock Kobus Wiese posted a “World Animal XV” on his twitter account (the source of which is unknown), with his No 4 spot filled by the elephant – possibly the right choice?  Also, one’s got to ask whether there is any significance in the No 10 being a “lioness”?  However, the leopard and zebra are also options at flyhalf. Here’s the team Wiese posted, which is not necessarily his chosen team. Here are some of the other teams put together by rugby fans, and lovers of the wild.  What do you make of these teams and who would you pick in what position?
