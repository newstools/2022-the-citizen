Al Ahly should have attacked more, they have higher quality players than Raja. “Pitso just thought about qualifying, but Al Ahly could have played better football. “Mosimane took a massive risk and it could have backfired, he’s lucky to coach Al Ahly. “Hussain El-Shahat was the best player on the pitch and he took him out. Al Ahly could have conceded more goals tonight, we were lucky. “I also didn’t see a single Al Ahly player improve during Mosimane’s time with the club.”Gomaa added that he wished that Mosimane could be sacked even if Al Ahly win the Champions League.  “I don’t wish defeat for Al Ahy so that Mosimane leaves, but Al Ahly can win with better performance for sure. “Once this Champions League campaign is over, Al Ahly can look for another manager. I am sure the team can improve with another coach. “The club board is happy with Pitso because he’s winning, but we are not happy because he makes Al Ahly look like a small club.”
