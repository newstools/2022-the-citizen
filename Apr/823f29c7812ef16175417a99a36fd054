Singer and actress Jennifer Lopez has announced her engagement to Ben Affleck, 18 years after they ended their relationship for the first time. The 52-year-old posted a video of herself appearing emotional and admiring a green ring in her newsletter, “On The JLo.” Her representatives then confirmed the engagement announcement to People magazine.  US media reported that the ring was an emerald-cut pale green diamond. “Bennifer” – the couple’s nickname from their first highly publicized relationship – set the internet alight last year when photos of them together again began circulating.  The pair first met on the set of the widely panned movie Gigli in 2002. They postponed their planned 2003 nuptials, then announced their relationship was over in early 2004.
