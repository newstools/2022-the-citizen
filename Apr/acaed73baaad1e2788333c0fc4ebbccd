President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to officiate the launch of the new locally manufactured Isuzu D-Max bakkie. The locally manufactured vehicle launch is significant because it symbolises the realisation of foreign investment in the country. Back in 2018, Japan’s Isuzu Motors Limited had committed to a five-year, R1,2 trillion domestic and international investment drive. The launch hosted by Isuzu Motors South Africa (IMSAf) will be held in the Eastern Cape at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Gqeberha. In 2019, Isuzu Motors Limited in Japan announced an investment of R1.2 billion in its next-generation vehicle programme in South Africa.

The new generation D-Max crowns Isuzu’s commitment to South Africa and is one of the successes achieved under the National Automotive Production Development Programme. According to the Presidency, the investment will secure more than 1 000 direct jobs at the plant and indirectly employ 24 000 people, contributing significantly to community upliftment in the region in which Isuzu operates. Isuzu Motors South Africa was established on 1 January 2018 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Isuzu Motors Limited.  It is the first manufacturing and distribution organisation outside of Japan where Isuzu has a 100% ownership. Ramaphosa will be accompanied by the Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition, Ebrahim Patel, and Eastern Cape Premier, Oscar Mabuyane.
