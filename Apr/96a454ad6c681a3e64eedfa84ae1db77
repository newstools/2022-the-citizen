Almost 300 people have been buried in a mass grave in Bucha, a commuter town outside Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, its mayor told AFP.  The Ukrainian army retook control of the key town from Russia on Saturday. “In Bucha, we have already buried 280 people in mass graves,” mayor Anatoly Fedoruk told AFP by phone. He said the heavily destroyed town’s streets are littered with corpses. AFP saw at least 20 bodies, men in civilian clothes, lying in a single street in Bucha on Saturday. “All these people were shot, killed, in the back of the head,” Fedoruk said.
