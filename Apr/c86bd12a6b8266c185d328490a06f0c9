The Currie Cup Premier Division match between the Sharks and the Bulls, scheduled to take place in Durban on Saturday afternoon, has been cancelled. Due to the heavy flooding in KwaZulu-Natal and the considerable loss of life and infrastructure damage across the province, and out of respect to their community in the face of the disaster the province is enduring, the two teams have agreed to cancel this encounter, according to SA Rugby.

The two other Currie Cup matches scheduled for the week will go ahead. The Lions host Griquas at Wits at 3pm on Thursday afternoon, while Western Province entertain the Cheetahs in Cape Town on Friday at 4.45pm. The Lions, who have lost all seven of their matches in the Currie Cup, have called in a few URC heavyweights in props JP Smith and Carlu Sadie, and hooker Jaco Visagie to bolster the side against Griquas. The seasoned Andre Warner will be at scrumhalf, while Tiaan Swanepoel will run out at fullback.
