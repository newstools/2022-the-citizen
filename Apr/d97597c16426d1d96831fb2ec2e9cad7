Orlando Pirates quest to finish the season in second place has become a bit harder after they were held to a goalless draw by Chippa United in a DStv Premiership tie at the Orlando Stadium on Wednesday.

But it was a vital point for the Chilli Boys, who are looking to collect as many points as they can to get away from the relegation zone. They are in 12th spot on the table with 26 points. Bucs had the best chance of the half early in the game during a goal-mouth scramble inside the Chippa box, but they couldn’t make it count as Chippa managed to clear the ball away from danger. The home side also got another chance through Bandile Shandu, but Chippa shot-stopper Lloyd Kazapua was quick to come off his line to make a save with his leg while Ntsikelelo Nyauza’s header from a corner went over the bar. The Eastern Cape outfit were playing quite deep, looking to catch the Buccaneers on a counter-attack. They got a chance after breaking through with Andile Mbenyane, but his attempted curler didn’t trouble Richard Ofori in the Pirates goal just after the half hour mark. In the second half, Pirates had to make a forced substitution after center back Olisa Ndah got injured and he was replaced by Happy Jele. Thembinkosi Lorch found himself with only a goalkeeper to beat with only 15 minutes remaining, but he was denied by Kazapua, while at the other end Ofori tipped Eva Nga’s header with his fingers before it hit the crossbar to keep the game goalless. The Buccaneers will be looking to do better in their next game as they face another relegation threatened side TS Galaxy on Monday at the Mbombela Stadium. Chippa, meanwhile, will host Mother City based club Cape Town at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on May 4
