The United Rugby Championship has digitally revealed the trophy that will be presented to the league champions at the first URC Grand Final on Saturday, 18 June. The incredibly unique piece of silverware is the result of a collaboration between the Bath-based, award-winning design agency, Matter, and the outstanding craftsmanship from the master silversmiths at Thomas Lyte, makers of the British & Irish Lions Series trophy, the Webb Ellis Cup, the FA Cup and the Ryder Cup. With the URC trophy in the final stages of production at the Thomas Lyte workshop, fans around the world have been treated to a digitally created 3D visual of the trophy, named the Array.
