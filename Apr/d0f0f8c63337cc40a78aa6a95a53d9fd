The top two teams in the group will make it to the tournament in the Ivory Coast, scheduled for June 2023, and Broos said he expect Morocco to be the most difficult opponent. “It is clear that Morocco are the best team in our group. In the Afcon in January they were eliminated by Egypt in the quarterfinals, they are a very good team. “They have some players in Belgium, like Selim Amallah, Tarik Tissoudali and Sofian Chakla, so I know this team very well. If we want to be first in the group we have to beat Morocco. “We played Zimbabwe twice in World Cup qualification (Bafana drew 0-0 in Zimbabwe and won 1-0 at home) so we know them very well. They are a tough team, but a team we have to beat. We are better than we were a few months ago, so I think if we can beat them twice it will be very good for us,” added Broos. “Liberia is a team I don’t know. So it is up to us in the next weeks to look at the games of Liberia. Maybe they are the weakest team in the group, but it is always dangerous to underestimate an opponent.”
