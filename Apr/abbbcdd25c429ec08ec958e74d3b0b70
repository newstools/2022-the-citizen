A moniker last used on the 997 generation 911, Porsche has reintroduced the Sport Classic designation on the latest 992 model as a special edition that will only spawn 1 250 examples worldwide. The work of Stuttgart’s Exclusive Manufaktur division, the Sport Classic is based on the coupe version of the rear-wheel-drive 911 Carrera S, albeit with a number of unique touches inside and outside. Externally, these include the widebody style only available on the 911 Turbo, a ducktail rear spoiler inspired by the iconic 1973 911 Carrera 2.7 RS, a double bubble roof, 20-inch at the front and 21-inch at the rear black accented alloy wheels, a gold surrounded Sport Classic badge on the engine cover, dual Sports Grey racing stripes and a choice of three colours; black, Agate Grey Metallic and Gentian Blue Metallic.

Additionally, subtle wood inserts feature on the dashboards, as well as the Porsche crest embroidered into the headrests, a gold 911 badge on the passenger side and 911 Sport Classic badge illuminated door sills. Fitted as standard with the Porsche Active Suspension Management system, the Sport Classic, like its predecessor, has been tweaked on the power front. Replacing the 3.0-litre twin-turbo flat-six of the Carrera S, the 3.7-litre twin-turbo unit from the 911 Turbo now resides at the rear with revised outputs of 405kW/600Nm. Though Porsche didn’t confirm any performance figures, it did reveal the selection of a single transmission, the seven-speed manual equipped with an auto blip-function on downshifts.  The powertrain also makes the Sport Classic the most powerful manual Porsche ever made as to the normally aspirated 4.0-litre engine 911 GT3/GT3 Touring punches out 375kW/470Nm. Priced from €272 714 (R4 565 807) in Germany, the Sport Classic is once again unlikely to find its way to South Africa once deliveries commence in July.
