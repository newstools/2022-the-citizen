Arthur Zwane insists that Kaizer Chiefs still believe in Itumeleng Khune, even though the veteran shot-stopper has not played for Amakhosi since August.

It is just a matter of selection. Brandon (Petersen) has been doing well, Bruce (Bvuma) and (Daniel) Akpeyi have been doing well. The opportunity will arise again and surely he will get his fair share (of appearances). “We still believe in him, he has that quality, the experience, and him being in the dressing room motivates the other players. “He is part of the team whether he is playing or not. He is a positive person and is looking forward to his turn, should it come any time soon. He is a 24 hour professional.” Once far-and-away the best goalkeeper in South Africa, and the Bafana Bafana captain, Khune has battled with his fitness in the last four seasons or so, making just 28 league appearances, compared to the 27 he made in the 2017/18 campaign on its own. The 34 year-old signed a two-year extension to his contract ahead of this season, so should at least be a part of the Amakhosi squad into the 2022/23 campaign.
