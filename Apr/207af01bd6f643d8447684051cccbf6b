The Blitzboks will face Fiji in the Cup quarter-finals of the Singapore World Rugby Sevens tournament on Sunday after finishing runners-up in Pool A after Saturday’s play. The second place finish was due to the SA Sevens team losing 21-7 to the USA in their final pool match, which snapped the team’s unbeaten run of 36 matches. The USA were deserved winners even though the Blitzboks scored a late converted try to make it 7-all before the USA scored the winner with the last move of the game. Earlier, SA beat Kenya 26-5, with Sako Makata getting a hat trick, while they also beat Canada 31-5 in their opening game. The match against Fiji is at 6.50am SA time Sunday.
