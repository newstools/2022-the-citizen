It’s advantage Simba SC after the Tanzanian club edged Orlando Pirates 1-0 in the first leg of the quarter-finals of the Caf Confederation Cup played at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium on Sunday evening. Former Pirates player Bernard Morrison won a penalty for Simba after he was fouled inside the box in the second half, and the spot-kick was scored by Salum Kampombe. Bucs had a decent start into the tie, but failed to come-up with goal-scoring chances whenever they were on attack. Striker Kwame Peprah and his supporting forwards Deon Hotto and Kabelo Dlamini were unable to break the rearguard of The Reds of Msimbazi. Instead, it would have been the home side who could have taken the lead in the earlier moment of the match having created better opportunities. In the 20th minute, Pirates had an injury scare after goalkeeper Richard Ofori collided with Simba attacker Pape Sakho, but the Ghanaian shot-stopper managed to get up after a couple of minutes. Just before half-time, Morrison created a good chance for himself to try and get the opening goal for his side after some nice touches in the box. However, Ofori made a great save to deny the winger.The second stanza went on to reach the half-hour mark with the team’s still unable to break the deadlock. But soon after, the hosts would go on to take the lead from the penalty spot after Morrison was fouled inside the box by Happy Jele.Kampombe stepped up to take the spot-kick and he successfully sent Ofori the wrong way to make it 1-0. In their quest to find an equaliser, Pirates were unfortunate not to have levelled matters in the 76th minute through Fortune Makaringe, whose shot hit the side net from close range. Bucs looked stronger in the last 10 minutes of the match with more numbers going forward, but they just couldn’t find the back of the net. The Soweto giants and Simba are set to meet once again in the second leg to be played at Orlando Stadium on the 24th of April.
