The Sharks will look to returning Springbok, fullback Aphelele Fassi, to bring his special form of magic on Saturday when the team host Leinster at Kings Park in a massive United Rugby Championship clash.Leinster come to Durban full of confidence from their successful campaign in the URC, but missing a number of internationals, while the Sharks have named an almost unchanged line-up from the one that scored a five-pointer against the Lions in their last outing.With Leinster’s focus alternating between the URC and the Champions Cup, player welfare plays a big role and to this end, they have only brought six players to South Africa with them from last week’s match 23 against Connacht.They still have numerous experienced internationals on their two-match tour and will, as their log position confirms, present an enormous challenge to a Sharks side itself riding a wave of confidence.Fassi makes a welcome return to the side after an injury lay-off that saw him miss a number of games and his speed, agility and X-factor will no doubt test the Irish visitors and tournament log leaders.The only other change to the matchday 23 is rotational, where Le Roux Roets partners Gerbrandt Grobler in the second row with Reniel Hugo moving to the bench.Sharks: Aphelele Fasssi, Werner Kok, Ben Tapuai, Marius Louw, Makazole Mapimpi, Curwin Bosch, Jaden Hendrikse, Phepsi Buthelezi, Henco Venter, Siya Kolisi, Gerbrandt Grobler, Le Roux Roets, Thomas du Toit (capt), Bongi Mbonambi, Ox Nche. Bench: Kerron van Vuuren, Ntuthuko Mchunu, Khutha Mchunu, Reniel Hugo, Jeandre Labuschagne, Sikhumbuzo Notshe, Grant Williams, Boeta Chamberlain
