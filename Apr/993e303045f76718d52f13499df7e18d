Experienced centre Juan de Jongh will make his return from injury for Western Province in their Currie Cup encounter with the Bulls at Loftus Versfeld on Wednesday. De Jongh comes straight into the starting line-up for the north-south clash, which kicks off at 8pm in Pretoria. Apart from De Jongh’s inclusion at outside centre, there is just one other change in the Province backline, with Timothy Swiel starting at flyhalf. And there is one change to the forward pack, with Sazi Sandi lining up at tighthead prop.
