Kaizer Chiefs’ DStv Premiership campaign took another hit with SuperSpot United beating them 1-0 on Saturday evening. This happened in front of Amakhosi’s supporters who were in the stadium for the first time since the advent of Covid-19. The game did not draw a big crowd as it would have been expected but that could be blamed on Johannesburg’s weepy and cold weather this weekend.

That was at least until the 40th minute when Khama Billiat went on a good solo run. The nifty footed attacker beat two SuperSport defenders but his attempt was saved by Ronwen Williams. His save however fell kindly for Nkosingiphile Ngcobo, but he just ballooned it over with the goal wide open in front of him. Chiefs did have the goal in the back of the net a minute before half time when Samir Nurkovic scored, but he had been offside and it was ruled out. Thamsanqa Gabuza also had a good chance to put Matsatsantsa in front a minute to the end of the half. He did well to chest the ball but it fell on his weaker left foot and he also ballooned it over. Chiefs continued their dominance in the second half and created some chances but found that Williams was no Easter Bunny as he denied them on a few occasions. But as Chiefs looked to get the goal on the other end they felt some spaces and Gabuza made amends for his earlier miss when he gave SuperSport the lead in the 68th minute. The loss meant Chiefs go down a place to fourth with Cape Town City overtaking them to third place after their 1-1 draw with second placed Royal AM.
