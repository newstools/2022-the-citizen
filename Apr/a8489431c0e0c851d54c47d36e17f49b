Former Mamelodi Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana says he might eventually be forced to hang up his boots if there are no offers coming his way. The veteran midfielder left Downs at the start of this season and he revealed that he is yet to have any offer placed on his table.“If an opportunity comes, I would have to decide if it suits my drive. But if it does not come, I will close the chapter because I’ve played for the longest time and it is time to face reality and understand that my services are no longer needed,” said Kekana.

At the present moment I am still training and it is something to just train not knowing what the future is holding,” Kekana said.The ex-Bafana Bafana player went to debunk media reports that linked him to Baroka FC, saying he has not had any communication with Bakgaga.“Those were rumours, I have not heard anything from Baroka and to be honest it was going to be a good opportunity for me to go and play for a club in Limpopo. If the opportunity comes I will think about it and decide based on how I feel on the day I get the offer.“When you have done what I have done for so many years and you have to take that break – which is the longest break I’ve taken in my football career – it is crazy finding myself waking up in the morning and not having the program that I used to have. I had to come up with my own program and I love that part because it defines real life,” he said.Many footballers usually take the route of coaching after retiring from the field, but the 36-year-old is not particularly sure if he is cut out to bark orders from the dugout.“I don’t know if I have the personality of being a coach but all I know is that I love the game and my whole life revolves around the game. everything that I know is about the game and if I were to have the coaching qualifications, that would be great because maybe when I get to a certain age in my life, my drive may direct me to that path.”
