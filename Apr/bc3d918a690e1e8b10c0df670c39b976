The Springbok squad is only set to be named towards the end of May or early June, depending on the progress of the South African teams in United Rugby Championship play-offs, but the Bok management is going full steam ahead in preparation for the Welsh incoming series. The Boks are set to face off against Wales over the first three weekends of July and will be eager to get off to a strong start in what is expected to be a very tough season. Following the Welsh series they battle it out in the Rugby Championship and then close the season out with an end of year tour to Europe where they will face France, Ireland, England and Italy. “We have had a close eye on the Six Nations because we are playing Wales in 11 weeks’ time and we have a tough schedule in terms of Six Nations teams as we play France, Ireland, England and Italy later in the year,” said Bok coach Jacques Nienaber. “The only top 10 teams we aren’t playing this year are Scotland and Japan and the only team outside the top 10 that we are playing is Italy and you saw what they did to Wales. “So I think it’s going to be a tough season for us, but that’s exactly what you want before a World Cup. You want to be tested by the best in the world and if you look at our schedule we will get tested by them.” ALSO READ: Nienaber explains why Louw, Roos will struggle to make Bok squad Despite the struggles of Wales in the Six Nations and the Welsh teams in the URC this season, Nienaber is still expecting a very tough challenge from them and one the Boks have to be ready for. “The Welsh have never won a series in South Africa and that is one of their big goals and what they are striving for. History has shown us it is going to be an arm wrestle,” said Nienaber. “They have also suffered a couple of big injuries recently, and since Rassie (Erasmus, director of rugby at Saru) and myself have come on in 2018 we have played Wales four times, with us winning twice and them twice. So it is going to be a challenge.”
