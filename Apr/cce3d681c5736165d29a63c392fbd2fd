It has been three years since the then 8-year-old Amahle Thabethe went missing on 6 April 2019.  Her family reported her missing at Tsakane police station. Thabethe would be 11-years-old now.  The police in Gauteng have issued a reward of R50,000 for any information that helps in finding the missing girl. This week is the three-year anniversary since she went missing. The police have no new developments so far. Thabethe’s case gained momentum when the whole country began to share posters about her, every year netizens try to keep her case alive by bringing up that she has not been found. Thabethe was playing outside her home in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, when she was apparently lured by an unknown man. “It is alleged that Thabethe was playing on the street with other children when an unknown man approached them, asking for directions to a certain house. Thabethe volunteered to show the man the house he was looking for and that was the last time she was seen,” said police spokesperson Colonel Dimakatso Sello. At the time of her disappearance, she was wearing a blue and white t-shirt, black jeans with pockets that were printed with hearts. According to Sello, a task team has since been formed to investigate on any information received. Anyone with information that can lead to the location of Thabethe or the alleged perpetrator is requested to contact Sergeant Theo Jacobs on 082 319 9865 or 081 442 4258.  Anonymous tip-offs can also be reported on MySAPS App or Crime Stop at 08600 10111. All information received will be treated as confidential. Christopher Kope of One Strong Voice Foundation said back in 2019 that it was rather odd that in a country with more than a million people, no one knew Thabethe’s whereabouts.
