Laboratory tests have detected 11.5 million Covid cases and 252,000 fatalities across the African continent. But the WHO Africa region said its study — which is still being peer-reviewed — suggests the officially confirmed numbers were “likely only scratching the surface of the real extent of coronavirus infections in Africa”. “A new meta-analysis of standardised sero-prevalence study revealed that the true number of infections could be as much as 97 times higher than the number of confirmed reported cases,” said WHO Africa boss Matshidiso Moeti. “This suggests that more than two-thirds of all Africans have been exposed to the Covid-19 virus,” she added.
