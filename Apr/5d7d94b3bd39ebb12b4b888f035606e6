BEST BET RACE 3 NO 5 DEAN STREET – WIN Lucinda Woodruff’s charge has raced twice for a second and a third and this looks the ideal race for this Master Of My Fate gelding to shed his maiden. There are a few first-timers but there does not seem to be too much optimism from their trainers which means Dean Street is worth a good bet and can be made a banker in all exotic bets. Aldo Domeyer rides. VALUE BET RACE 5 NO 3 EXCEEDER – EACHWAY This Elusive Fort gelding has been consistent over 2000m and Greg Ennion’s charge looks to be well in at the weights for this race. The blinkers are back and he should run a very competitive race. At odds of 7-1 he looks a decent eachway bet, especially with in-form Richard Fourie in the irons.
