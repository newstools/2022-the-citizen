Former South African president Jacob Zuma reached an amazing milestone on Tuesday 12 April as he celebrated his 80th birthday. His ex fiancé and cast member on The Real Housewives of Durban, Nonkanyiso ‘LaConco’ Conco took to social media where she shared a picture of Zuma holding their son and wished him a blessed day as he celebrated his 80th birthday. The former Vuma FM presenter started off her tribute post by saying that Jacob’s birthday will be a day that she will never forget and will always celebrate for the rest of her life.  “12 April a date that will forever be a celebration of my treasures,” said Conco.

When the first episode of season 2 of The Real Housewives of Durban aired, LaConco revealed to her fellow Cast member Sorisha that she and Zuma are no longer in a relationship and that she has been raising her son with her mother since the split.  “I never knew I would be at a stage where I am raising my son with my mom. I never fell in love… to be in this situation I am at today. I don’t think the scars will ever heal,” said Conco.
