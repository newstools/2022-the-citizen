Despite the reduction in levies meant to give South Africans some reprieve from spiralling fuel prices, Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe on Monday announced that fuel prices are still set to see an increase. Mantashe announced the adjustment of fuel prices based on current local and international factors, with effect from 6 April 2022.

The increases in both petrol and diesel would have been close to R2.00 per litre and over R3.00 per litre respectively if there was no intervention, he concluded.
