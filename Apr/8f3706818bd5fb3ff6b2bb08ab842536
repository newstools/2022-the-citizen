Simba SC have revealed that they will report Orlando Pirates coach Mandla Ncikazi to the Confederation of African Football (Caf).ALSO READ: Pirates coach Ncikazi laments hostility and poor officiating after Simba loss This comes after Ncikazi claimed that Pirates were subjected to some harsh hostility in Tanzania. The Bucs mentor also complained about  poor officiating during his side’s 1-0 loss to Simba in the first leg of the quarter-finals of the Caf Confederation Cup at Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium last Sunday.“The treatment we got from the stadium, the hotel, the airport … why do you do this as Africans to other Africans? Are we going to improve the football on our continent this way? And you are all proud that Simba won. They did not win, the referee made them win,” said Ncikazi during his post-match interview.“You should be ashamed of yourselves as Africans. “But, listen to this, we are going to treat Simba with decency when they come (to South Africa). We are going to show them what is meant by being a true African by giving them the best hospitality and treating them like human beings. You don’t treat visitors the way we get treated here (Tanzania) and you should be ashamed.” Simba chief executive officer Barbara Gonzalez has denied Ncikazi’s claims and even went as far as saying that Ncikazi’s outburst was due to the Bucs technical team being under pressure. “We will take action against Pirates; not only through CAF, but diplomatic efforts because of the defamatory statements that are not acceptable, not only for Simba, but for Tanzania,” Gonzalez was quoted as saying by local media in Tanzania via mtnfc.co.za. “We now fear for our lives when we come to South Africa. Some people like to play victims and will say anything to protect their jobs; we know what happened in South Africa with the Pirates technical team and we know they’re under pressure.”
