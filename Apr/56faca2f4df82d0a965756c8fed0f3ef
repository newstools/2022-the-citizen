The management of AmaZulu FC are said to be considering giving interim coach Brandon Truter a new contract should he manage to end the season in a decent position, particularly in the top eight, says a source. Truter was brought into the club following the departure of Benni McCarthy at the club, with the former Swallows FC coach’s set to be until the end of the season. Swallows are currently in seventh place on the league standings after managing to grab their first victory this year when they beat Baroka FC 1-0 with Truter in charge. The remaining six games in the league will be a huge test for Truter, and the AmaZulu have pinned his hope on him.

But, they just want to see if he will be able to manage the team and the players. The important thing is that they want to see the club finish inside the top half because things have been very bad this season. “So, once he manages to achieve that, he will have a sit down with the management to talk about the way forward. To be honest though, he was not the first choice to be called and take charge, it is just that he was available. But the club saw his work at Swallows and they believe with a squad he has he can be able to achieve anything that they want because the management is very ambitious and they want trophies for the people of KwaZulu-Natal people,” said the source.
