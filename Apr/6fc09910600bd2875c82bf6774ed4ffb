One of the more under-rated jockeys in South Africa, Serino Moodley is starting to get the recognition his ability deserves. That recognition translates into good rides – as evidenced by his strong book for the Greyville Polytrack meeting on Monday. Every one of Moodley’s six mounts has a good winning chance and should be considered for all bets. Perhaps his best for the day In Miss Charlotte in Race 7, with Giambattista in Race 1 another livewire. Miss Charlotte, trained by Garth Puller and a three-time winner from 28 runs, has had Moodley in charge on three occasions – for one of those wins, a second and a third. That third placing was just a fortnight ago, when the mare finished less than two lengths behind Blackwhitedynamite – in open company, over this course and 1400m distance. Back among rivals of her own gender, she looks the business. Wendy Whitehead-trained Giambattista has been suffering from a bout of “seconditis”, being runner-up in four of his six outings to date. The connections have chosen to geld the son of Wylie Hall to get the extra bit of mental and physical focus needed to tip him into the winner’s box. Moodley’s other rides at the meeting are Ralph The Rascal (Race 2), Clean Slate (Race 3), Syx Hotfix (Race 4) and Monarchy (Race 5) – all contenders.
