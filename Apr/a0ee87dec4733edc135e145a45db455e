Molemo “Jub Jub” Maarohanye made his return to social media after a scandal at the end of 2021.  The music artist and host of the popular reality show Uyajola 9/9 on Moja Love was accused by several women of sexual assault, abuse and rape in December 2021. The rapper apologised, however, this hasn’t helped his career which has been on hold pending the investigations against him. On Wednesday, Jub Jub posted a clip of himself with DJ Cleo in the studio recording a new song.  The song, Amaswidi, is a mixed genre of kwaito and hip hop, which Jub Jub said will drop on Thursday at midnight. Many of his fans were happy with his return, flooding his comments section, expressing they had missed him and were happy to see him return. The star resurrected his career in entertainment after his prison term from 2012 to 2017.  He was found guilty of causing a car accident near a school on a public road that killed four pupils.  Actress and businesswoman Amanda Du Pont, who dated Jub Jub for about two years, shared a video detailing the alleged abuse she was subjected to when they were a couple. The video was a reaction to Jub Jub boastfully bragging to MacG during an interview that he had “smashed” Amanda. “First of all Molemo, you raped me. I was raped for two years solidly. Please don’t make it sound like it was a relationship. I was absolutely afraid to leave, afraid of the power your mother had,” she said.
