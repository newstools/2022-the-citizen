Seasoned Proteas women’s cricketer Mignon du Preez has retired from ODI and Test cricket. Du Preez’s last action for South Africa was at the recent Cricket World Cup in New Zealand. The former captain said she’d remain available for T20 cricket. “I’ve been fortunate enough to play in four ODI World Cups. I would however love to prioritise time with my family and hopefully start a family of my own soon,” said Du Preez. “The time is right for me to step away and allow the next generation to continue to grow this beautiful game of ours.” Du Preez played in 154 ODIs. She made her debut in 2007 and captained the side on 46 occasions in ODI cricket. She finishes her career with 3,760 runs at 33, with 18 half centuries and two centuries.
