Explosive remnants of Syria’s war killed nearly 30 civilians, including more than a dozen children, last month, a war monitoring group said Wednesday. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said “29 civilians, including 12 children, died from explosive remnants in March” and that another 29 were wounded. The latest toll brings to 73 the total number of people killed by explosive remnants since the start of the year, according to the monitor, which relies on a wide network of sources inside Syria. Explosives left by all sides in fields, along roads or even in buildings in Syria’s decade-long conflict have wounded thousands of civilians and killed hundreds of others. This is a modal window.

Syria’s war is estimated to have killed nearly half a million people and displaced millions since it began with a brutal crackdown of anti-government protests in 2011.
