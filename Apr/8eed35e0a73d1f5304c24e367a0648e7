AmaZulu FC interim coach Brandon Truter believes the club can achieve their mandate, which is to finish in second place on the log and qualify for the Caf Champions League.ALSO READ: What Truter is doing differently to McCarthy to get AmaZulu purring againThis is despite the fact that Usuthu trail second-placed Royal AM by nine points with only five games left before the end of the season.  Truter, however, is backing his charges to achieve their goal especially after winning two consecutive games, where they beat Maritzburg United and Baroka FC by the same 1-0 score-line. “I wouldn’t have taken the job if I didn’t back myself and also doing research and knowing AmaZulu with the quality of players available. I had no doubt the mandate will be reached. I feel confident about reaching that mandate and even confident about maybe qualifying for the Champions League again by finishing second,” said Truter. “So that’s still possible with 15 points to play for. I back my boys. There’s quality throughout this team.” Usuthu will have to obviously strive for consistency if they are to achieve their goals, but there are still five more games for them to play and looking at the gap between them and the teams above them, they could still need the results from the other games to go in their favour even if they win all their remaining games. Coming for Truter and his troops next is a clash against neighbours Royal AM at Chatsworth on Sunday.A loss against Thwihli Thwahla will all but end AmaZulu’s chances of qualifying for the Champions League.
