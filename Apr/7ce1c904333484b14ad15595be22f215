The South African Weather Service (Saws) said the persistent and heavy downpours have done a lot of damage in KwaZulu-Natal, with more showers expected. Adverse weather conditions are expected along the coast and adjacent interior. At least two people have died, and ten are missing in KwaMashu and Umlazi near Durban. Saws said there is an orange level 8 warning for disruptive rainfall on Tuesday which could lead to widespread flooding of informal settlements, schools, bridges and major disruptions of traffic over the eastern part of the province. Speaking to eNCA on Monday night, Medi-Response Rescue spokesperson Paul Herbst said the biggest problem “is that all the main roads are flooded so the rescuers can’t get to these scenes”.  Despite warnings from emergency personnel in Amanzimtoti on Monday, a driver attempted to cross a flooded road and barely made it to the other side.  Remember: It’s not safe to drive across a flooded road, and a vehicle can be swept away in less than 30cm of moving waters.
