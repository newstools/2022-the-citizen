Video Assistant Referee (VAR) played a major role in Mamelodi Sundowns’ condemnation to a 2-1 loss for the first time in 30 games as they lost 2-1 to Petro Atletico in the first leg of the Caf Champions League quarterfinal at the 11 Novembro Luanda in Angola. Neo Maema’s stoppage time goal was ruled out by VAR after the move towards the attack was marred by an foul and in the end, Downs have all the work to do in the return leg in the capital city.

About 10 minutes later, the host pulled back one of their own and it was the team leader, captain Tiago Leal who scored a volley from close range to beat Downs captain Denis Onyango. The goal was created by Jesus Carneiro on the right flank, as the dread-locked defender sprung in a cross that made sure that the hosts level matters. Downs could have restored their lead in the 34th minute when talisman Themba Zwane did everything right, from the interplay with his teammates and got into a good space. However, he could not find the back of the net as he beat goalkeeper Gomes but the woodwork came to the rescue of the Atletico’s goalie. Just before referee Danny Sakizwe blew his whistle to signal half-time, Petro got themselves in the lead for the first time in the game through Adriano Yano. Yano’s goal was created by Jaerdi Teixeira, who played a cross from the right flank and it was received by Leal, who flicked the ball on the path of Onyango. However, the Downs goalkeeper could only parry the ball, which landed at the feet of Yano and the the 29-year-old did not make a mistake in front of goal.
