The estranged wife of renowned Senior Counsel, Advocate William Mokhari, appeared alongside two male suspects for a formal bail hearing at the Alexandra Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Boitumelo Joyce Mokhari and her two co-accused, an alleged prophet Shadrack Malipane and Jacob Malope, were released on R3,000 bail each without any conditions. This is after they were arrested earlier this month for conspiracy to kill Mokhari. Police acted on a tip-off about a plot to murder the advocate with allegations received that the firearm that was to be used for the commission of the alleged offence to kill him was delivered to Malipane. NPA regional spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said men were arrested on 14 April 2022 with Mokhari’s estranged wife handing herself over to the Sandton South African Police Service (Saps) on 20 April 2022 with the assistance of her legal representative. The trio faces a charge of conspiracy to kill Mokhari. “On arrival at the premises of the prophet, police conducted the search where the firearm and ammunition were seized from the boot of Malipane’s vehicle,” Mjonondwane said in a statement. During the bail application on Monday, state prosecutor Lufuno Godfrey Maphiri argued that the safety of advocate Mokhari would be compromised if the accused were released on bail. “He briefly presented the state’s allegations citing that at the centre of the plot, is the divorce proceedings instituted by advocate Mokhari against his estranged wife,” Mjonondwane added. The case was postponed to 14 June 2022 for further investigations. Compiled by Thapelo Lekabe NOW READ: Four-year-old girl reunited with family after kidnapping ordeal
