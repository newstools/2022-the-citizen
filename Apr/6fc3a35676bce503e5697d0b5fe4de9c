TAB Champions Day takes place on Saturday 30 April at Turffontein Racecourse, and the public is encouraged to attend the exciting horseracing that includes the TAB Premier’s Champions Challenge and six other graded races.  The day is themed around celebrating our champions of horseracing and soccer. Entrance is free, and there will be plenty of food and drink on sale indoors, with access to the grandstand, as well as in the Turf Room, where there will be live music, a big-screen TV and seating available.  The day will be a family affair with children’s entertainment such as pony rides, jumping castles and face painting. The TAB Premier’s Champions’ Challenge will see Kommetieding, Flying Carpet, Puerto Manzano, Zeus and MK’s Pride, who won the GR1 HF Oppenheimer Horse Chestnut Stakes, in the running.  The Computaform Sprint will feature Real Gone Kid, Bohica, and Hello Winter Hello.  Wilgerbosdrift Triple Tiara winner Rain In Holland is running in the Gerald Rosenberg GR2 race. On the day, TAB, South Africa’s official totaliser betting system, will launch the new TAB4Racing app, an exciting new tool to make betting on the horses easy and fun, catering for both seasoned punters and those looking to try betting for the first time. The app will livestream Grade 1 and 2 races and share racing news, amongst many other features. Fundi Sithebe, CEO of 4Racing, says they are enjoying renewed public interest in a day at the races: “We are having a celebration of champions this Saturday to add to the atmosphere and entertainment of the day, and to celebrate the launch of the TAB4Racing app that will make betting more accessible and support the improved horseracing experience we are building.” Gates open at 11am and secure parking is available off Turf Club Street.
