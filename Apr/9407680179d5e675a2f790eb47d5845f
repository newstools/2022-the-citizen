The complainant approached the Hawks after the Sars officer kept hounding him for the money. “A covert operation was conducted [on Wednesday] by the Hawks team in Alberton where a handing over was to take place,” said Mogale. “An undercover agent handed over R40,000 cash to the Sars official and he was arrested.”  ALSO READ: Sars detects billions in fraudulent claims from taxpayers
