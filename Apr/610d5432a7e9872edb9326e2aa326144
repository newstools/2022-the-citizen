The pop-up restaurant cooking competition My Kitchen Rules South Africa (MKRSA) is back with a bang for its fourth season. MultiChoice made the announcement on Tuesday and said interested home cooks can now enter for the new season. As season three was a resounding success, judges Chef David Higgs, and award-winning artist, cook, guitarist and vocalist J’Something will suite once again to critique the home cooks dishes.  The format of MKRSA sees a pair of contestants, passionate about food, open a pop-up restaurant in their homes, as each couple hosts their competitors and the two celebrity judges with a themed three-course dinner during the instant restaurant round.  In season three of MKRSA, the contestants didn’t have the luxury of using their home kitchens as seen before because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The group were all in one location, using and transforming their pop-up kitchen into a restaurant.

This past season we saw that the pandemic and lockdowns really resulted in many people killing it in the kitchen, and we know that we can expect the same – or possibly even better – this time around.”  The winners of MKRSA crown will walk away with R1-million, season three winners Izak and Wessel are still basking of their recent success.   “It’s been hard work, but we poured ourselves into all the challenges the experience presented us, and meticulously laboured over every detail throughout the competition. The devil is in the detail, they say! “It takes a village, and we would like to thank all of those who supported us along the way,” they said on Instagram.  Entries for MKRSA are opened, hopefuls must fill in the online application form and send a video to M-Net of their best dish.
