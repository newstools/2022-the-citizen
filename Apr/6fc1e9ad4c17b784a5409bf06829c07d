Several pupils from two schools have landed in hospitals after eating “space cakes,” said Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi , raising concerns about the increasing consumption of the dagga-infused cakes by pupils. He said eleven Grade 12 pupils at Randfontein High School, west of Johannesburg felt sick on Thursday and immediately rushed to clinics and hospitals for treatment. “Two of the learners were returned home; while nine learners were hospitalised, one of whom was in a critical condition but is now stable.  “It was established that these learners consumed ‘space cakes’ sold by another Grade 12 learner, who is now facing suspension as a result of breaking the school’s code of conduct and endangering the lives of his fellow learners,” Lesufi said.
