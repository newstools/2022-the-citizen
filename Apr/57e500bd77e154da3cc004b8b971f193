Elon Musk is no longer joining the board of Twitter, the CEO of the social media company said late on Sunday, in a reversal less than a week after announcing the Tesla chief would be appointed. Musk was named to join the Twitter board after buying a major stake in the firm and becoming its largest shareholder. “Elon has decided not to join our board,” Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal tweeted.

Billionaire tech entrepreneur Musk is a frequent Twitter user, regularly mixing in inflammatory and controversial statements about issues or other public figures with remarks that are whimsical or business-focused.  He has also sparred repeatedly with federal securities regulators, who cracked down on his social media use after a purported effort to take Tesla private in 2018 fell apart.
