The Real Housewives of Lagos (RHOLagos) have landed in South Africa both literally and figuratively and all eyes are on the cast of the show and the South African guests who attended Thursday night’s launch event. The post-Covid period has seen a revival of the red carpet and fashion-hungry fans are always eager to see how guests of such prestigious events interpret the event theme.As such, RHOLagos found itself trending long before the show even went live on Friday morning as the fans had a lot to say about the pink carpet looks from the launch event St Summer Place in Hyde Park, Johannesburg.Influencer Foyin Ogunrombi (popularly known as Foyin OG) was met with intense criticism when she hit the pink carpet in a floral print babydoll dress with flowers in shades of blue and white paired with super high chunky platform heels and a white gele. Mihlali Ndamase on the other hand was heaped with praised for her beaded and bejewelled Keys Fashion gown paired with a Dolce & Gabbana clutch and matching shoes. Mihlali’s date and friend, Lasizwe Dambuza, also hit all the right notes with his outfit that had him looking like a “fine young man” from Lagos. Apart from Londie London, the other Real Housewives of Durban Stars didn’t quite wow fans with their looks.  Namely fan-favourite Nonkanyiso “LaConco” Conco who pitched up in a midi-length forest green silk number paired with a matching head wrap. Londie London wore a rich, purple gown with lots of sparkle, Jojo Robinson opted for a layered pink tulle number while Annie wore a shot, bedazzled pink number to match the RHOLagos pink carpet. Although not all of the RHOLagos housewives could make it to their Joburg event, Chioma Ikokwu, Iyabo Ojo, Mariam Timmer and Toyin Lawani-Adebo were able to make it and they shut the red carpet down with their elaborate looks.
