South Africa will host the inaugural ICC Women’s under-19 T20 World Cup tournament in January 2023, the ICC announced on Sunday. Sixteen teams will play in the tournament, which will comprise 41 matches. The tournament will serve as a curtain-raiser to the 2023 ICC Women’s T20 Cricket World Cup that will also be held in South Africa from 9 to 26 February. CSA Chief Executive Pholetsi Moseki commented on the announcement: “This is fantastic news, and we acknowledge the ICC’s show of faith in South Africa, and our vision and desire to work collaboratively to host this momentous event. “On the back of witnessing the fine displays at the recent World Cup, the host cities and venues will be just as excited and ready to set the world stage for the promising cricketers to perform on and be immersed in what will be a first major tournament in the young careers of most of the players.” CSA Board Chairperson, Lawson Naidoo said; “This is a watershed moment for the game of cricket, including for the growth of women’s cricket in the world and in South Africa. “After the tremendous success of the senior Women’s World Cup in New Zealand this year and the general excitement and interest around the game, it is also important to shine a light on the next generation to ensure sustainability of the sport amongst aspiring girls and women everywhere. “The latest displays from the Proteas (women’s team) have shown there is an abundance of talent within our country. The introduction of a developmental tournament like the U19 Women’s World Cup will provide our young players with critical exposure and competition against their peers with the world watching.“
