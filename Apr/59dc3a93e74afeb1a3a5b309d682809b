It took a few minutes for the ambulance to get onto the field after it was called following Paseka Mako’s injury that left him unconscious on Tuesday evening.  Mako had collided with Richard Ofori and was hit on the head, leaving him with a concussion and he was unconscious for a few moments. This was during Pirates’ goalless DStv Premiership draw with Baroka FC at Peter Mokaba Stadium. After the Pirates medical team assessed Mako, they called for the ambulance but the driver was nowhere to be found. He appeared later and was shouted at by concerned supporters of both sides as the situation had turned intense with everyone fearing the worst. “The less said about that (the ambulance) the better,” Pirates coach Fadlu Davids told the media afterwards. “There was nobody in the ambulance and the driver had to be found, I don’t know, maybe they were (also) watching the game.  “But they have to be on call, they have to be ready. Credit to our medical team … they were on the field within 10 seconds. The reaction from the ambulance team was definitely not good enough for PSL standards,” added the co-coach.  Mako was rushed to hospital and the club have shared an update on his condition.  “Following the emergency injury involving defender Paseka Mako in the DStv Premiership clash against Baroka FC last night, Orlando Pirates Football Club can confirm that the 28 year old is in a stable condition. The doctor has revealed that CT scan results have shown no signs of a skull fracture or any brain haemorrhage, however, the player has sustained a fracture to the face and nose. “He will remain in High Care and will be assessed by the neurosurgeon again this morning,” reads the statement from the club.   After the game, Baroka coach Kgoloko Thobejane was unable to do his post-match interview as he looked close to tears.
