Steve Hofmeyr caused a social media controversy when he claimed Disney’s agenda is to groom children to have sex with animals. He also believes the + in LGBTQ+ represents bestiality.  This follows Disney’s head of content, Karey Burke comments that members of the LGBTQIA community and racial minorities will see greater representation in future productions.  You can read all about Steve Hofmeyr’s bestiality rant elsewhere on The Citizen but stick around first because this story just took another turn.  Adding spice to what would have been a dull Sunday afternoon, Phumzile Van Damme joined the conversation and called Hofmeyr a ‘dom p**s’.  We doubt any translation is necessary, but if you need some help in deciphering our clever asterisk placement, Google provides the following translation: “Yirre but you’re a stupid [cat]” Her reply was in response to a tweet in which the singer said: “They say (scream) that the + is an inclusive sign for everything EXCEPT those pedos and zoophiles. But I know this wasn’t always so.” This begs the question: How does Steve know?  However, the Tweet of the Day Award goes to XanderGotLostAgain, who asked:  “Don’t you have an Apartheid flag to pleasure yourself to, or broken pumpkins to sing about instead of pretending to be knowledgeable in subjects you clearly know nothing about?” Earlier, Hofmeyr said he “complained about Disney sexualising our kids, but the LGBTQ+ is upset about something different.” NOW READ: Steve Hofmeyr thinks Disney wants kids to have sex with animals
