When Mike de Kock goes to the trouble of carting horses about the country, we had better pay attention. The trainer sends two of his charges to Durban for Thursday’s Polytrack meeting at Greyville and it will be with deadly intent, surely. One of the raiders from Randjesfontein is Motown Magic, this week named among De Kock’s five entries for the Durban July. The three-year-old gelding was not part of the classics programme on the Highveld but must be highly thought of, nonetheless. He is a two-time winner from 11 starts and has five seconds on the record, too. Last time out, in mid-February, the son of American stallion Uncle Mo showed he is maturing into a rather good racehorse, making all the running to hammer a Middle Stakes field over 2400m at Turffontein. His current merit rating is 91, not be high enough for a Durban July slot, and De Kock needs to dial it up a bit – and what better place to start the process than at Greyville, home of the big race in a couple of months’ time. In Thursday’s Race 5, an MR84 Handicap, Motown Magic faces some decent locals, such as Airways Law, Gimme A Star and Monarchy, but will have the heft of the master trainer’s expectations to give him an edge. The travelling companion is Bonnaroo, a promising three-year-old filly who lines up in Race 8, an MR81 Handicap over 1200m. She has a win and two seconds from her four outings thus far and one suspects she might go well on the Poly.
