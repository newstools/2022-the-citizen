Amina Muaddi speaks up after A$ap Rocky cheating rumoursAfter receiving an increased amount of attention for all the wrong reasons on Thursday, shoe designer Amina Muaddi has broken her silence.  Curiosity about who she is spiked after rumours that rapper A$Ap Rocky cheated on his pregnant girlfriend Rihanna with Amina.  According to Google trends data, there had been over 50,000 searches for Amina Muaddi as of Thursday in South Africa alone.  This was after various American gossip blogs ran stories stating that Rihanna and Rocky (both 33) had broken up after she found out that he was cheating. The blogs ran with a tweet shared by Fashion blogger Louis Pisano. According to Daily Mail, Amina is a shoe designer and has worked on some designs for Rihanna’s Fenty footwear. Rihanna herself is often seen in custom shoes from her own label designed by Amina. The publication further reports that Amina is rumoured to have dated A$ap Rocky some years ago and had also worked with him on a few designs.  Taking to Instagram on Good Friday, Amina explained the reason behind her decision to break her silence. “I’ve always believed that an unfortunate lie spread on social media doesn’t deserve any response or clarification, especially one that is so vile.”  Amina added that she did not believe that “this fake gossip – fabricated with such malicious intent – would be taken seriously.” In the end, she didn’t really say much but she made sure to highlight her position that what was said about her and A$ap Rocky was fabricated and that she had the utmost respect and affection for Rihanna.“While Rih is continuing to live her serene, best-dressed pregnancy life and I go back to business – I wish everyone a beautiful Easter weekend!” concluded the designer.
