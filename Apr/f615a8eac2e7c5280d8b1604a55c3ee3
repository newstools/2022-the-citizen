VAAL  BEST BET RACE 3: SWINGER: 8-BRENDEN JAMES AND 11-SPIN DOCTOR These two horses dominate this race and are expected to fight it out. However, there is a strong preference for Brenden James who had an excellent comeback run last time after a long rest in which he was gelded. The Swinger is the safe bet, but one could also take some Exactas which will pay quite a bit more. VALUE BET PICK 3: RACES 1, 2, AND 3. Race 1: 6, 7 Race 2: 2 Race 3: 8, 11 One has to find the winner of all three races but this bet will cost just R4 and should bring a favourable return.
