Royal Race Day at Turffontein was postponed for a week due to cats and dogs last weekend, and the entire race card has been transported, as if via a time machine, with remarkably few dropouts. The major difference is a slightly more cheerful weather forecast, but there is little cause to revisit forecasts for Saturday’s on-turn action. The field for the Grade 1 headliner, the HSH Princess Charlene Empress Club Stakes, is packed with quality. Among the fillies and mares lining up at the 1600m pole are a sprinkling of Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal raiders, adding more intrigue than usual to an event that was originally named after one of the South African turf’s greats and latterly had Benoni’s second-most famous person’s moniker attached. Trainer Mike de Kock’s four-year-old Sparkling Water is a wonderfully versatile horse. Her biggest triumph to date was in the 2800m Western Cape Stayers (Grade 2) at Kenilworth in late January, but she has also won over 1450m – as recently as last October at Turffontein. After her Cape Town sojourn, Sparkling Water had a couple of months out of competitive action before stepping out again in the 2000m Colorado King Stakes at the Big T. She probably needed that run, but still put in a good showing in finishing a close third behind smart Second Base. It is alleged that De Kock might know a thing or two about winning big races at the big city course. With the magic hands of S’Manga Khumalo in assistance, the maestro could steal the thunder from a couple of better-backed opponents. Those rivals include two erstwhile Cape Town horses recently transplanted to the Highveld: Princess Calla and Zarina. These fillies have matched strides with the very best and carry their connections’ lofty expectations of making a mark on up north. And there are more runners with talent and form to force their way into consideration. Sprinkles, She’s A Keeper, Mount Laurel, Bold Fortune and Under Your Spell would not be outlandish winners.
