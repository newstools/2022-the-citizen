On 7 April 2020, Bopape withdrew R500 000 under the false pretence that she would make the funds available to the members of the SSA operations.  After internal investigations were done, an opened packet containing R330 000 was found inside her office and after interrogation, she eventually admitted to stealing R170 000. The matter was then reported to the police and she was arrested on 26 January 2021.  The NPA’s north Gauteng regional spokesperson, Lumka Mahanjana, welcomed the sentence handed to Bopape. “The NPA hopes that this sentence will send a strong message that such crimes of theft, corruption and fraud will not be tolerated,” Mahanjana said.
