As the seasons change and the weather starts to feel cooler, you may consider closing your windows and doors to create a warmer and cozy environment in your homes, but this may cause many health risks to yourself and your loved ones due to the lack of ventilation and resultant poor air quality.  Try these six tips to improve the quality of the air in your home and to ensure that your spaces are well ventilated and purified frequently.  Opening your windows regularly allows for fresh air to enter into your home and clean your indoor air at no cost.  This has many health benefits such as improved blood pressure and heart rate, clean lungs, strengthening your immune system, and giving you more energy and a sharper mind. Not only do houseplants add to the décor and aesthetics of your home, but they can also purify the air in your home as they usually filter it and improve the air quality in whichever space you put them in.  Try putting houseplants in all of the rooms in your home where you spend the most time to purify the air in those rooms. Most cleaning products contain harmful chemicals that damage your air quality, especially if you do not regularly open your windows or doors to let fresh air in. Research shows that cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting products potentially contribute to nearly 20% of indoor pollution. Try switching to non-toxic cleaning products for your home to ensure that the quality of the air in your home is not compromised.  Dust can trigger your allergies and irritate and inflame your upper airways and throat tissues, which often leads to inflammation that makes it harder to breathe. Having too much dust in your living spaces can compromise the quality of air in your home. Make it a habit to dust your furniture frequently by taking cushions, bedding and rugs outside to bang out the dust outside of your home. Vacuum and sweep your carpets, corners and other surfaces often, and keep surfaces clean of clutter.
