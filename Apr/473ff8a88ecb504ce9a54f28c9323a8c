The Springboks will get their preparations for a testing international season underway this weekend as head coach Jacques Nienaber and his management team host the first of two alignment camps. The first three-day camp will start in Durban on Sunday and the second camp is in Cape Town between 1-5 May. A selected group of players from around the country have been invited to the camps and will appear in both cities as the Boks gear up for their exciting season. Further players, however, could be invited to the second camp.

Alignment camps will also be hosted with the overseas-based players in England and France, as well as virtual meetings, all of which will take place between 16-25 April. With the Springboks’ first Test against Wales less than three months away, Nienaber said the alignment camps were vital to get the players into the right frame of mind as they looked ahead to an important season with an eye on next year’s Rugby World Cup in France. “We are excited to get our season underway and these alignment camps are vital as we have not played for several months,” said Nienaber. “These sessions will ensure that we are all on the same page on and off the field when we begin our official training sessions.”
