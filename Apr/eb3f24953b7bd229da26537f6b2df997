Tommy Fleetwood will return to the Nedbank Golf Challenge as ‘Africa’s Major’ celebrates its milestone 40th anniversary from November 10-13. The European Ryder Cup star lifted the trophy in 2019 – the last time the event took place due to the Covid-19 pandemic – and he will defend his title when the event makes a much-anticipated return to Sun City’s Gary Player Country Club.  The penultimate tournament on the 2022 DP World Tour schedule will also carry an increased number of DP World Tour Ranking Points, with 7,000 points available. “I’ve had some fantastic experiences at the Nedbank Golf Challenge and I can’t wait to get back to Sun City,” said Fleetwood. “I’ve been lucky enough to be able to call myself the champion for longer than usual, but I’m certainly looking forward to starting my defence in November. “It was a great feeling to come through the field on that final day to lift the trophy. Add that to the top 10 finish in 2017 which helped me on the way to becoming European Number One, and I certainly have some great memories of the tournament which I would love to replicate.” The 2022 Nedbank Golf Challenge will once again be included on the DP World Tour schedule in partnership with Nedbank and Sun International, and as the penultimate event before the season-ending DP World Tour Championship, Dubai. The winner of the Sunshine Tour Order of Merit will receive a place in the 64-player field at Gary Player Country Club. The last edition of the Nedbank Golf Challenge in 2019 delivered record attendance figures and sold-out hospitality. Ticketing information for the milestone 40th event will follow in due course.
