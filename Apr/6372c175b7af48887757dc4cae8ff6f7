Drip footwear has marked its success by branching outside of their unique and colourful locally made sneakers, to introducing a new fragrance available for purchase for both men and women. Taking to social media, the South African footwear brand announced that they will be releasing a new product line, which is a fragrance named “Finesse by Drip”. “Drip is bringing you, a new fragrance: for him and her…Ladies and Gentlemen…The Drip Finesse Scent,” the brand said in a post on Twitter. The fragrance comes in two different scents for men and women, one being Ruby for her which is packaged in a red perfume bottle, and the other being Arion for him which is packaged in a blue cologne bottle.
