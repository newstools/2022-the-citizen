After experiencing what it takes to juggle between playing continental football and domestic football, AmaZulu FC interim coach Brandon Truter now understands why some teams tend to struggle. Usuthu played in Guinea last Friday, where they faced Horoya in their final group game of the Caf Champions League, but the team failed to advance to the next round of the tournament. With many hours of traveling and having to come back to play Baroka FC in the DStv Premiership on Wednesday, Truter reveals that his team was struggling with fatigue, but they ended up going on to win the tie 1-0 as Luvuyo Memela scored in additional time.

But, for us, 35 hours of travel, we couldn’t even train on Tuesday, we still had fatigue. We were 30 minutes out on the field and we had to come back. The travelling, now I understand why teams take a dip after playing champions league and coming back with the amount of traveling and fatigue and having to play in 48 hours,” said Truter. The Usuthu coach praised his team for their effort as the KwaZulu-Natal club registered their first victory in the league this year, but says Baroka didn’t back down. “It was a massive effort from the boys and I have to give all the credit to them. We have soldiers here. But I am happy, it is the first win for AmaZulu this year. They had their chances, Baroka is a team that plays for their lives now in the PSL. They came at us in the first half, they threw everything at us  and the boys stood strong.” AmaZulu occupy seventh place on the league standings with 32 points from 24 games.
