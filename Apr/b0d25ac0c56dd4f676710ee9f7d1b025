Phakaaathi has been led to believe that SuperSport United have received applications from a couple of European coaches who are interested in succeeding Kaitano Tembo as the head coach of the club.

The board feels it is time for SuperSport to compete for the league instead of being a top-eight team and for that to happen, they might consider roping in expertise from abroad to take the team to the top where it belongs,” said a source.Meanwhile, as previously reported, SuperSport could reunite with their former coach Gavin Hunt, a source has revealed.  “I hear people complaining that Tembo was treated unfairly if you look at how the club sold some important players and never replaced them. But he knew about all that, he was part of the planning process as the club changed from buying ready-made players and focused more on developing their own,” said the source.Former AmaZulu coach Benni McCarthy is also linked with the Matsatsantsa coaching job, but as reported by Phakaaathi earlier, word has it that SuperSport have zero interest in former Bafana Bafana striker, who was recently let go by Usuthu. Recent reports have suggested that the capital city outfit were considering roping in McCarthy to rescue the team as Tembo is enduring one of his worst seasons at the helm of Matsatsantsa. But those rumours have been set aside by a high ranking official at the club who spoke to Phakaaathi anonymously.
