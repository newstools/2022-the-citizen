Arthur Zwane The current assistant coach and former Chiefs winger seems to be many fans’ favourite to take over from Baxter. Zwane and Dillon Sheppard took over in a caretaker capacity when Gavin Hunt was sacked towards the end of last season, and the pair got Chiefs into the Caf Champions League final. Zwane and Baxter have not appeared to see eye to eye at times this season, and it could be that ‘10111’ is now given another chance. Verdict: Likely to at least get the job in a caretaker capacity ALSO READ: Kaizer Chiefs sack Stuart Baxter – reports Benni McCarthy A former Orlando Pirates striker and self-confessed Buccaneers fan, McCarthy might not seem like an ideal fit for Chiefs, but he remains one of the hottest properties in the South African coaching market right now. McCarthy has had successful spells at Cape Town City and AmaZulu, who he guided to a second-placed finish in last season’s DStv Premiership. He does, however, tend to lash out at his players when things do not go well, and such antics from the former Bafana striker are unlikely to go down well at Chiefs. Verdict: Would be a risk but Chiefs and him might just be a good fit Pitso Mosimane Mosimane has recently signed a new deal with Al Ahly, but could he be tempted by the chance to take charge of Chiefs, and start a rivalry for the ages with his former side Mamelodi Sundowns. There is certainly plenty of bad blood between Sundowns and Mosimane, which might inspire ‘Jingles’ to decide he wants to bring Masandawana down a peg or two. Already regarded as one of the best coaches on the continent, Mosimane would add another notch to his belt if he could revive the glory days at Chiefs. Verdict: A fantastic story if it happens, but Chiefs probably can’t afford him
