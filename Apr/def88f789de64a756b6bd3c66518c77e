Former SuperSport United head coach, Kaitano Tembo is said to have attracted interest from a few teams in his homeland of Zimbabwe.ALSO READ: Sekhukhune set to appoint new coach, Da Gama favourite to land the gigBut the 51-year-old is understood to not be interested in coaching in Zimbabwe. The former Zimbabwe international was fired from Matsatsantsa A Pitori this month and at this point, he might continue to be jobless if he does not consider the coaching gigs from his country. “The standard of the Premier Soccer League is very high and it would be taking a step back if Tembo goes to Zimbabwe. The only offer we might entertain is if the job is that of being the head coach of the Zimbabwean national team,” said a source close to Tembo’s camp.Meanwhile, as reported Tembo recently went for an interview for the co-head coach job at Sekhukhune United, but lost out on the post to Owen Da Gama.
