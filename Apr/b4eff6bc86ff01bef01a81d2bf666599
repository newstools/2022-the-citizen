The Leeds United vs Man City Premier League match went down at Elland Road and coach Jesse Marsch had one goal in mind: to extend Leeds’ unbeaten run to six matches.  The Whites were currently in a safe spot and only needed another two or three points to push them to the third straight top-flight campaign.  The atmosphere was electric, and the battle was tense. Leeds have not lost a Premier League home game against Man City since their 2-1 defeat in September 2000. Man City cemented their dominance early on by driving the first goal home 13 minutes in. Leeds retaliated, but Laporte and Co kept the Leeds attack at bay. The Sky Blues scored their second goal at 54 minutes in when Foden delivered it from the corner. The third goal came from a trademark Man City passing move with Jesus finishing in the 78th minute. With just seconds to go, Fernandinho secured Man City’s fourth goal. Leeds played a good game and had a strong first half, but were caught out during the second half when they began to tire.  Leeds suffered their heaviest defeat in Premier League history when they went up against Manchester City back in December 2021.  It was Man City’s 33rd win for the year, which put them on par with the record Liverpool set in back in 1982 when Bob Paisley was at the helm. The battlefield – Etihad Stadium – saw Manchester City mercilessly demolishing the Whites 7-0. In fact, Marcelo Bielsa said it was the worst performance of his tenure.  Meanwhile, Guardiola was selected by the League Managers Association Panel as the recipient of the LMA Performance Of The Week Award. NOW READ: Football ‘super agent’ Mino Raiola dies aged 54
