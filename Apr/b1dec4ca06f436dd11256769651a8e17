Lehlohonolo Seema admitted that he had hardly prepared for Golden Arrows’ DStv Premiership fixture against Mamelodi Sundowns. He said this after his side were embarrassingly beaten 6-0 by the champions-elect.  It could be that the Lesotho coach had an inkling of what was to come or he made the biggest blunder of his career. Either way, he has suffered the consequences for it.
