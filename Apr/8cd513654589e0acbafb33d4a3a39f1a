Springbok coach Jacques Nienaber was happy with the outcome of the first alignment camp of the season which wrapped up in Durban on Tuesday, saying they achieved the goals set out as they stepped up preparations for the coming international season. A group of 22 players attended the first camp, which featured eight information sessions presented by the coaching team on what the Boks would like to achieve on the field, the processes in being selected for the national squad and touched on several different aspects of the game. “We are pleased with the outcomes achieved at our first alignment camp and I believe the players have a good idea of what is expected of them on and off the field as we look forward to a challenging international season,” said Nienaber. “Once we have finalised our squad for the Wales Tests, we will have a training camp where we will put all of the aspects of the game we discussed into practice as we look to fine tune certain areas of our game.” This alignment camp will be followed by camps with overseas-based players in England and France, as well as virtual meetings, all of which will take place between Saturday 16 and Monday 25 April, and another for local players will take place in Cape Town from Sunday 1 to Thursday 5 May.
