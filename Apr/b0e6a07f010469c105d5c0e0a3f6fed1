While being assaulted by a group of men, a truck driver was struck down by a vehicle on the M13 in Durban. The driver pulled off to the side of the road after experiencing mechanical difficulties. While attending to the truck’s problems, he was attacked by a group of men who were reportedly waiting in the bush nearby. During the attack, he was hit by a passing car. Despite this, the suspects continued to beat him. The assailants fled as other vehicles stopped at the scene. Netcare 911 medics were called and found the driver unconscious on the ground. “Medics assessed the scene and found that the man had sustained critical injuries and was treated on scene by an emergency care practitioner, who placed the patient on a ventilator,” Netcare medics said. The man was stabilised and rushed to hospital for further care. This comes after two suspects were arrested for attempted truck hijacking and being in possession of a radio reception blocking device on 24 March. The incident took place 20 kilometres outside Paul Roux towards Senekal in the Free State. It was alleged that around 11:50pm, a 34-year-old driver was driving from Durban to Bloemfontein on the N5 in Harrismith when he reportedly noticed a suspicious blue VW Polo and Nissan Hardbody following him. As the truck driver reached Paul Roux, one of the suspects allegedly got on the truck’s trailer in an attempt to hook it off. The driver reportedly got out of the truck, ran for safety, and managed to inform the nearby police station.
