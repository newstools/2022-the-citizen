Baroka FC interim coach Vincent Kobola has a difficult task ahead of him in trying to save the team from being relegated and looking at their last four DStv Premiership fixtures, the Limpopo side have their work cut out for them. Bakgaga’s survival doesn’t only depend on them with the side having to cross their fingers for teams above them to drop points in their last fixtures.

Their poor campaign sees them rooted at the bottom of the league standings, five points away from safety. The club’s performances so far led the management to demote head coach Kgoloko Thobejane, who is now steering the wheel in the reserve team campaigning in the DStv Diski Challenge. It will be crucial for the Limpopo based side to start winning their games, starting with Golden Arrows on 4 May at the Peter Mokaba Stadium to have any chance of saving their status. This will be the first time Kobola takes charge of the team since the removal of Thobejane in the hot-seat after the club lost 3-2 to Swallows FC in their previous game. After the Arrows game, Baroka will face another struggling club Chippa United, before taking on SuperSport United and wrapping up their campaign with a clash against Kwa-Zulu Natal based side Maritzburg United. But, Baroka are not the only team in trouble, with second from the bottom side TS Galaxy and 14th placed Swallows FC tied on 23 points and they will both be looking to avoid the relegation/promotion playoffs. The Rockets and the Birds though, both have some tough fixtures coming up and any slip up for either of the two will see them end up in danger. Galaxy has Orlando Pirates, Cape Town City, Marumo Gallants and Chippa in their last fixtures, whereas Swallows will face AmaZulu FC, SuperSport, Chippa and Kaizer Chiefs in their remaining games.
