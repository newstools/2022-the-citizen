AmaZulu FC are believed to be looking at roping in Steve Komphela as their next coach next season.

He is no stranger to the city having spent a few years there as coach of Golden Arrows who he turned into a competitive side with young players.  “They have received so many CVs even from outside the country. I am not sure if Steve also sent his CV or if they are head hunting him, but he is a firm favourite with the club’s management,” said the source.  It will however be difficult for Usuthu to land the former Kaizer Chiefs mentor because of his contractual obligations at Mamelodi Sundowns where he is a senior coach.  Earlier this season Orlando Pirates were said to be keen on having him join them, but Sundowns refused to release him as he has a contract there until 2024.  Usuthu will have to fork out big bucks to activate his release clause if they are really interested in having him. Brandon Truter is currently acting as an interim coach and the former Swallows mentor has done well since taking over from McCarthy, registering two back-to-back league victories against Baroka and Maritzburg United.
