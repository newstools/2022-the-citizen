United shot-stopper Dlamini had saved a Deon Hotto penalty earlier in the game, but went on to make a mistake later on in the game which saw Fortune Makaringe taking advantage of it and scoring the only goal of the match which gave the Buccaneers maximum points on the night. Even though Sekhukhune dropped points, Makhubedu felt that his charges were the better side and refused to blame Dlamini for the mistake that cost the team three points. “We played better, we were the better team. We love our goalkeeper, Ayanda will remain our best goalkeeper. Him, Tapuwa Kapini and Toaster Nsabata are our best goalkeepers. Maybe he (Dlamini) is the best goalkeeper in the league by far. He is still the best goalkeeper in the league and we love him. I know he will come back strong, he is a very strong character,” said Makhubedu after the match. “About the game, we did well, I’m happy for the boys and I can’t wait for the next game. If we take the same performance to the next game we will do well. We are the best, I still trust my boys, they are the best, they are good.” Sekhukhune’s next fixture is against TS Galaxy on 16 April.
