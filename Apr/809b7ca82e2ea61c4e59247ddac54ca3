The entire TS Galaxy family wishes you a speedy recovery,” wrote the KwaNdebele side on their social media platforms. Mako, who has been a reliable and solid left-back for the Buccaneers was left behind when the club went to Tanzania where they continue with their Caf Confederation Cup campaign. Pirates face Simba SC on Sunday, and the Rockets took the time to also wish them well. “May God give the entire Orlando Pirates team the necessary strength as they represent SA in the Caf Confederation Cup in Tanzania. Much Love from Tim Sukazi,” wrote the Rockets. It is worth mentioning that a scuffle between Galaxy and Pirates broke out at Orlando Stadium earlier this year. This was after Sukazi was allegedly denied access to the changerooms. The matter was believed to have soured relations between the two clubs. Accusations flew from both sides after the incident.
