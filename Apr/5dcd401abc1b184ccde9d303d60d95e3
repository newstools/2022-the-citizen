Dumisani Zuma is slowly making his comeback into the setup at Kaizer Chiefs after spending a few weeks on the sidelines and getting his social life right. The Pietermaritzburg born player was caught by the police for a drinking and driving offence and was suspended by the club afterwards. He was also sent into a rehabilitation program to help him with his social life problems. There were allegations that he overindulged on the Queen’s tears. But he seems to have got over that and is now a part of the team again at Chiefs and has been on the bench for the last two DStv Premiership games. “Dumi has been obviously better at training and that is why he is on the bench,” said Chiefs coach Staurt Baxter. “I don’t think it is a case of ‘let’s wait six months, and after that we can bring him back’.
