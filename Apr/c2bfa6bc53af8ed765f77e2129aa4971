South Africa currently has 38,797 active cases of Covid-19, from a total of 3.785,398 confirmed cases and 3.646.241 total recoveries. The country identified 4,954 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. This increase represents an 22.5% positivity rate, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, announced on Friday.  The majority of new cases today are from Gauteng (44%), followed by Kwa-Zulu Natal (27%). Western Cape accounted for 12%; Eastern Cape accounted for 6%; Free State accounted for 4%; North West accounted for 3%; Mpumalanga accounted for 2%; and Limpopo and Northern Cape each accounted for 1% respectively of today’s new cases. Five new Covid-19 related deaths were recorded, and of these, 2 occurred in the past 24 – 48 hours. This brings the total fatalities to 100,360 to date. 24.445,151 tests have been conducted in both public and private sectors.  There has been an increase of 121 hospital admissions in the past 24 hours. Speaking during a virtual media briefing on Friday morning, Minister of Health Dr Joe Phaahla said the Department of Health have noticed a rise in Covid-19 infections over the last two weeks, especially in Gauteng, Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. “As of yesterday, Gauteng alone accounted for 53% of positive cases, KZN 23% and Western Cape 11%,” Phaahla said. He said the country reached 6,000 Covid-19 infections on Wednesday, and while there was a slight decline to just over 4,000 Covid-19 infections on Thursday, this could be due to the public holiday on Wednesday that saw fewer people testing. Phaahla said the country’s positivity rate remains quite high at 17%, adding this is the first time South Africa is seeing a resurgence in infections since ending the National State of Disaster.
