James Verity-Amm will earn a starting berth for the Bulls when they take on Glasgow Warriors in a crucial United Rugby Championship match at Loftus Versfeld on Friday night. The Bulls have made four changes to their backline for the clash in addition to a solitary personnel change in the forwards pack. Verity-Amm, who has shown some fine form for the Tshwane-based side in the domestic Currie Cup, has received an opportunity to start on the right wing this weekend. The young and talented Canan Moodie, who has proven himself as a solid outside back who featured on the wing so far this season, will show his versatility when he starts at fullback. The Bulls will also have a changed half-back pairing which will see Zak Burger combining with the experienced Morne Steyn. Hard man, Arno Botha, makes a return to the starting XV where he will do the No 7 jersey. A strong bench will see the return of Harold Vorster to action after missing last weekend’s game against Benetton Rugby, while Cyle Brink will be providing loose-forward cover. “We have a tough task ahead of us this Friday,” said Bulls director of rugby, Jake White. “Despite their defeat to the Stormers last week, Glasgow Warriors are a formidable side that we expect will bring a huge challenge for us. They are a well-coached group with a number of highly talented internationals in their squad. “We will need to be alert and be at our best for the entire 80 minutes.” The match kicks off at 7pm. Bulls: Canan Moodie, James Verity-Amm, Lionel Mapoe, Cornal Hendricks, Madosh Tambwe, Morne Steyn, Zak Burge, Elrigh Louw, Arno Botha, Marcell Coetzee (capt), Ruan Nortje, Walt Steenkamp, Mornay Smith, Johan Grobbelaar, Gerhard Steenekamp. Bench: Jan-Hendrik Wessels, Simphiwe Matanzima, Dylan Smith, Janko Swanepoel, Cyle Brink, Embrose Papier, Chris Smith, Harold Vorster.
