The ANC eThekwini region said in a statement: “We call on the reporters not to make a speculative and divisive reporting that seeks to drive a wedge within the movement and society.  “Irresponsible reporting will shift the attention from real enemies towards sensationalism and derail the investigation.” Mokoena was also part of a task team deployed to rebuild structures of the ANCYL in KZN. “We would like to send our deepest condolences to the family, friends and comrades from his branch and the movement in general for the loss of a dedicated and promising cadre. “Cadre Mfundo loved and lived the ANC. The killers have robbed his family, movement and society of a bright mind.” The ANC called for swift action from law enforcement agencies. NOW READ:  Unhappy ANC branches up in arms
