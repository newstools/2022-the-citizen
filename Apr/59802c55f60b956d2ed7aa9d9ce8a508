Rising Bulls utility back Kurt-Lee Arendse’s standout performances in a strong March campaign for his team have earned him the United Rugby Championship Player of the Month Award. Arendse scored twice in the Bulls’ 55-20 victory over the Dragons, but also shone in his overall contributions for the team as they made a clean sweep of their Northern Hemisphere opposition in March. In voting for Arendse as the standout player for March, the South African rugby media were effusive in their praise of “the threat he’s brought to the Bulls’ attack” and also highlighted the fact that “Arendse’s underrated ability is creating for others and not just finishing”. According to the voting media, “He has been electric, solid and he has done everything right at every stage for the Bulls…His line-breaks have led to multiple try assists and he gets the team onto the front foot each time he touches the ball.” The Bulls have moved up  to seventh place on the URC log.
