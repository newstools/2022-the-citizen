But it was their coach Lucky Nelukau who got almost every tongue wagging.  And no, not because of his confident comments where he declared that they will win this cup again this season – Tshakhuma are technically the defending champions after they won it last season but then sold their DStv Premiership status to Marumo Gallants.  It was because of the way the TTM technical team dressed. Nelukau and his assistants were clad in full military camouflage attire for the game.    Asked by Far Post at the end of the game about this, he said: “You know I had a brother, who all of you should know, Arnold Mudau… He passed away a few weeks ago.  “This is for him. This cup I am playing for him. He was always dressed like this. If you drive past Louis Trichardt you will pass a house in Tshakhuma (painted) in camouflage like this,” said Nelukau.
