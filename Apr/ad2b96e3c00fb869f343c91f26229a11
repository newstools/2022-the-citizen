Over the last 10 games, the big talk has been about how Mamelodi Sundowns have been banged in goals, but as the saying goes – ‘the best way to defend is to attack’, which Downs do ever so well.

It is just a pity that when we are counting those numbers we are not counting Goss in that space because he has also made tremendous strides but unfortunately he has not really had a chance to prove his worth,” said Mngqithi.“Maybe it is a lesson for all of us to not discard any of the players too early because I do believe that all of our goalkeepers are good shape. If we are talking about a department that anybody would want to work for at Sundowns is that goalkeeping department because of the support that they give to each other is unbelievable. No wonder whoever players does well,” he added.Former Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport United goalie, Pieterse has played seven games so far this season, and while that may seem like a low return, Mngqithi is happy about the 30-year-old’s contribution to the team.“We are very excited with Reyaad because a lot of people ruled him out very quickly and Wendell has always kept the belief in him and always said he has good things that many people are aware of. He is stable and he makes us build from the back easier because he is very good with his feet and that is very important for Sundowns. Kennedy is also strong on that aspect and the work Wendell is doing in that space must not be taken for granted and we are honoured to work with a goalkeeper coach of his quality,” concluded Mngqithi.
