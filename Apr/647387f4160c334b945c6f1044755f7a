Kalou was part of the ASEC squad that lost 2-1 to Chiefs in the third-place play-off at the 1999 Vodacom Challenge, though he did not play in the match, but it was a side that contained the likes of former Mamelodi Sundowns man Siaka Tiene, and ex-Arsenal and Manchester City star Kolo Toure.  “I can’t wait to send this picture of me with the Kaizer Chiefs jersey to Siaka Tiene. He is always telling me about his time at Mamelodi Sundowns, but now I can show him my picture with the Kaizer Chiefs jersey,” Kalou told the Chiefs website, which added that Kalou remembered well the visit to play Chiefs in 1999.
