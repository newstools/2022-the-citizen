The MEC for the department of community safety and transport management Sello Lehari emphasised that taxi violence is a matter that always needs to be ‘nipped in the bud’. The MEC reiterated this when welcoming the executive of the Santaco Provincial Taxi Council (PTC) that was elected earlier this year. “The taxi industry is full of challenges that needs leadership that is hands on. I am hopeful that Santaco, together with government will curb each and every hindrance that comes our way by constantly engaging each other,” said Lehari.

Lehari explained that people rely on the taxi industry for transport, so for their sake and for the economy of the province they should continue joining forces to serve the public.  “Please ensure that your members co-operate, and that matters come to our table for discussion before things go completely wrong,” Lehari added. At the end of March, protests took place in Cape Town, with the Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association (CATA) and the Congress of Democratic Taxi Association (CODETA) marching to Premier Alan Winde’s office in the Western Cape. They marched to the offices to hand over a memorandum over the impounding of taxis and unfair requirements for releasing the vehicles. The Mother City’s major roads were brought to a standstill  due to the Cape Town Taxi Strike. This comes after taxis blocked major highways across the city, including the N2 highway.
