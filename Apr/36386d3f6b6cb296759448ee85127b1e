The brother of former Springbok loose forward Pedrie Wannenburg, who died in a motor vehicle accident last weekend, says he hopes what happened in Houston, Texas, will serve as a warning to young drivers. Wannenburg, the 41-year-old former Springbok and Bulls forward, died in an accident after an alleged 16-year-old driver, fleeing from police, crashed into the rugby player’s car. Wannenburg’s eight-year-old son was seriously injured, but his 10-year-old daughter escaped without serious injuries. Callie Wannenburg, Pedrie’s younger brother and also a former rugby player, told Maroela Media the 16-year-old responsible for the crash would have to live with the consequences for the rest of his life. “I feel sorry for the child. He made a poor decision and will now have to live with it for the rest of his life,” Callie said. The teenager has apparently been charged with “felony murder”. Callie and his wife were expected to fly to the USA on Wednesday. According to Maroela Media, Callie was informed of the accident in the early hours of Saturday.

We saw what the car looked like and expected the worst, but it was still difficult to have to deal with.” Callie added the accident should serve as a lesson to young drivers. “I even sat with my young kids and explained to them how every decision has consequences. This specific child made a wrong decision and I feel sorry for him for the road he will now have to walk.” Callie said eight-year-old Francois, who hurt his back in the accident, is recovering well.
