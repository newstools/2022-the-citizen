TURFFONTEIN INSIDE BEST BET RACE 4 SWINGER: 1-MIX THE MAGIC AND 4-LA BANQUIERE The decision to move today’s meeting to the Inside track at Turffontein due to heavy rains at the Vaal has resulted in the early favourite being withdrawn from Race 4. That has opened the way for La Banquiere and Mix The Magic who should fight it out. VALUE BET RACE 5 NO 10 POTTINGER – EACH WAY The move to Turffontein and the wet track could work well for this Paul Peter-trained runner.  He has run second in his only start at the course and has a win and a second (at this track) I the wet and with Warren Kennedy up, it could all work in his favour. His one impediment is a wide draw but over 2600m he will have opportunities to over come that.
