The ongoing conflict involving Russia and Ukraine – with Russian President Vladimir Putin launching a full-scale invasion on 24 February – stems back to the 1950s with the transfer of Crimea.  The invasion of Ukraine – said to be the largest military attack in Europe since World War II – is an escalation of the 2014 Russo-Ukrainian war, when the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity (Maidan Revolution) ousted then-President Viktor Yanukovych. Now in 2022, President Vladimir Putin questioned Ukraine’s right to statehood and accused the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) of threatening Russia’s security.  Ukraine said on Sunday it had found more than 1,200 bodies in the Kyiv region, the scene of atrocities allegedly committed by Russian troops, as residents in the country’s east braced – or fled – ahead of an expected massive offensive. Heavy bombardments hammered Ukraine through the weekend, adding to mounting casualties six weeks into Russia’s invasion of its neighbour.

Then in 2014, the focus was once again on Crimea and parts of Donbas during the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity, resulting in the regions being internationally recognised as part of Ukraine.  At the time, the Euromaidan protests resulted in the removal of President Viktor Yanukovych on 22 February 2014.  In response, Russian soldiers surrounded and seized control of Crimea, defying the referendum of 1991. Uprisings in Donbas turned into a full-blown war to control Donetsk and Luhansk.  A stalemate eventually ensued after repeated failed attempts at a cease fire.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

After marathon talks between US and Chinese officials, Washington also expressed concern about “alignment” between Russia and China. The discussions come after reports Moscow is seeking military and economic support from Beijing.
