The old adage goes that you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. Good thing then the Ford EcoSport is a car and not a canine. Having been around for about a decade, there is no denying the Blue Oval’s little SUV is getting long in the tooth.  But being such a solid product, Ford has managed to keep it fresh over the years with some minor little updates here and there. The latest party trick in all new Ford EcoSport Trend and Titanium models is the addition of the FordPass Connect system.  This clever system, also available on the Ranger and Everest, enables the EcoSport to keep up with the times and gives it firepower in a segment that has become densely populated.  And the best part about the FordPass Connect system is that you don’t need a degree in rocket science to operate it.

And very importantly for a woman driving on her own, the app allows instant dialling of Ford’s 24-hour Roadside Assistance. The great news is that while the owner must carry the mobile data cost for the app, there is no hidden data cost for the modem for the entire life of the car. This includes the seamless periodic over-the-air software updates.
