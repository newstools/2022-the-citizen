Swallows FC let a lead slip before playing to a 1-1 draw with Marumo Gallants at Peter Mokaba Stadium last Sunday.ALSO READ: Irritated Baxter says he will go if Chiefs wants him toA win against Gallants would have seen Swallows leapfrog TS Galaxy and into position 14 on the log standings.  The Birds, who are in 15th place, had a good start in the match after striker Rudzaigh Gamildien scored the opening goal just two minutes into the match, but it was later cancelled out by Katlego Otladisa in the 20th minute. Swallows coach Dylan Kerr was happy to see his striker back in scoring sheet, but believes his side could have done better had they not given Gallants players so much respect. “A great start, that’s what we needed, Gamildien needed that because he missed one like that against Maritzburg United, even closer. But his composure this time around it worked. And I was thinking, yeah, this one he will go for it. But we gave Phillip Ndlondlo, Monde Mphambaniso and Miguel Timm too much respect. The midfield didn’t close, the defence was too deep and just before we gave the free-kick away in a poor area, we didn’t defend right,” said Kerr. Gallants mentor Dan Malesela admitted that the match was tough, but said he was not happy with some of the decisions on the field. “A very difficult game, but there are a lot of questions about what happened on the field, worse is that we had one of our players (Mpho Mvelase) hospitalised. But there was no yellow card or anything. So, I said from then on I am not going to say anything. I will keep quiet and focus on my team and that’s exactly what I did,” said Malesela.
