Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema said he is not concerned about criticism directed towards him by Operation Dudula members, adding that they are merely trying to gain popularity by using his name. Malema also accused Operation Dudula members of trying to imitate him. “They are new in what they are doing. If you listen when they speak, they all imitate me. There is no principle to engage them. I’m dealing here with principle,” he said in an interview with the SABC. Operation Dudula has accused Malema of supporting illegal foreigners in South Africa. The movement has gained prominence in South Africa after it started targeting foreign nationals, accusing them of taking jobs from locals.
