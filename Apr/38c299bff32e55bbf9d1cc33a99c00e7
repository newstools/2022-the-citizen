Kaizer Chiefs are set to come down hard on defender Njabulo Ngcobo, who threw a tantrum and refused to shake hands after he was substituted in a DStv Premiership game against Golden Arrows on Wednesday afternoon.

He was substituted towards the end with Daniel Cardoso taking his place. As he walked out, co-coach Dillon Shepard tried to shake his hand and he ignored him and stormed off.  That’s when goalkeeper coach Lee Baxter shot up and grabbed him by the shoulder trying to reprimand him and tell him he needs to go sit on the bench. But he violently shook him off and continued to go sit alone behind the bench.  “Kemiso (Chiefs’ digital manager) and Kaizer Junior (sporting director) were fuming, they said he would be dealt with because what he did brought the club’s name into disrepute,” said a source who was at Princess Magogo where the game took place.  “They said they would have a meeting with him at the hotel. Coincidentally, they were set to meet with his agent to talk about some issues which were unrelated to what happened on the day,” said the source.   Some Amakhosi fans have put the blame on Baxter for the way he grabbed Ngcobo saying he escalated what could have just been a storm in a teacup. Arthur Zwane told the media on the day that as a former player he understood the emotions Ngcobo was going through, as he was replaced after making costly mistakes.
