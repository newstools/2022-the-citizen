The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) this week urged residents in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) who are affected by the floods to apply for SRD grant vouchers.  The vouchers are meant to provide temporary relief to people affected by the floods – mainly those “who are unable to meet their family’s most basic needs”, Sassa said.  Sassa is providing food vouchers worth R1,200 per family, as well as additional grants for families who lost loved ones due to the natural disaster.  Furthermore, school uniforms will also be provided to learners in need. Here’s what you need to know and how to apply.  Those in need of assistance should submit their contact details to the ward councillors or social workers at their nearest municipality.  Sassa said the vouchers will be made available for one month, as most residents’ lives “will normalise”, and the R350 SRD grant will still be available. Sassa said applications for the SRD disaster vouchers will be processed immediately after the assessment.  Once approval has been granted, the voucher will be issued.

The party has written to the municipal speaker Thabani Nyawose as some councillors had not been briefed or provided with a clear directive as to what will be expected of them.  The DA said: “We can confirm that the Speaker has not given that directive, and the DA has since written to him for clarity. All DA councillors are ready to assist with the application for this much-needed relief as soon as the Speaker gives the necessary directive and guidance.”
