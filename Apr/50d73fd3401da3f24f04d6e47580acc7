Orlando Pirates midfielder Linda Mntambo claims that Chippa United came to their game at Orlando Stadium looking for a point and they got it.ALSO READ: Pirates slip up in home draw with ChippaThis comes after the Chilli Boys held Bucs to a goalless draw in a DStv Premiership encounter on Wednesday. Pirates struggled to break a firm Chippa defence, which limited the Buccaneers’ chances of creating goal scoring opportunities or even getting a goal in their pursuit to finish the season as runners-up to Mamelodi Sundowns and book their spot in the Caf Championship League. Mntambo was brought in the second half for Abel Mabaso, with the Bucs bench going for some fresh legs to add onto their attack. But, still, Pirates’ just couldn’t find the back of the net, with an early chance by Terrence Dzvukamanja inside the Chippa box being cleared, while shot-stopper Lloyd Kazapua made a brilliant save to deny Thembinkosi Lorch in a one-on-one situation. “What we wanted from the game was to get maximum points and move up the log. But, it wasn’t for us, we played against a team that was well organised defensively. No disrespect for them, but I think they came here for a point. They kept their shape so well at the back and they defended for their lives,” said the midfielder. following the draw, Pirates now trail second-placed Royal AM by five points with four games to go before the end of the season. Bucs’ next game is against relegation-threatened TS Galaxy at Mbombela Stadium on 2 May. Mntambo says all focus now has to be on their clash against the Rockets and forget about the previous result. “But, for us now is just to go back to the drawing board and prepare for the match on Monday against TS Galaxy.”
