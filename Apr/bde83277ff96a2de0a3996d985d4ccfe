Arthur Zwane says Kaizer Chiefs could be back to challenging for honours as soon as next season – of course with a little luck on their side. ALSO READ: Zwane breaks silence on working relationship with ex-Chiefs coach BaxterAmakhosi have gone eight straight seasons without a single trophy to their name and it is beginning to weigh heavily on the club known for their penchant for trophies. But the interim coach believes things could turn around soon.  “These things happened. They do happen to the best teams in the world… It is where you go through a slump and you try to fix things but they are not coming your way,” says Zwane when asked about the matter.  “But yeah, we keep pushing and hoping that things will change for the better because the last thing we can do as a club is to give up. We are positive that things will change for the better.”  Zwane was part of the Amakhosi side who were looting every trophy on offer some 15 years ago. At that time the side used the slogan ‘Operation Vat Alles’   “When I came here, there was… I think the players that I was with at that time (were different). Things were not like this. A lot has changed now, the game itself has evolved. With us there was room to focus because there were not that many things in terms of trying to enjoy your life.  “But today things have changed… There is social media. I can’t imagine what Njabulo is going through right now. In the past you could do something like that and get away with it because it would not be blown out of proportion on social media.  “But look at Njabulo’s situation right now, you are thinking about his mental state if he would be ready for the next one because it is not about what has happened. But what we want to do and achieve going forward.”
