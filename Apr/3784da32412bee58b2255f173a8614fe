Word has it that SuperSport United have zero interest in former AmaZulu and Cape Town City coach Benni McCarthy, who was recently let go by Usuthu. Recent reports have suggested that the capital city outfit were considering roping in McCarthy to rescue the team as Kaitano Tembo is enduring one of his worst seasons at the helm of Matsatsantsa.

But those rumours have been set aside by a high ranking official at the club who spoke to Phakaaathi anonymously. “In football we know that we as football administrators come to the media and say things and other things happen. But with this one, I can assure you that we are not going to employ Benni at this point. “We are confident in Kaitano and the young team he is trying to build. In fact, we probably can’t even afford Benni,” said the source.
