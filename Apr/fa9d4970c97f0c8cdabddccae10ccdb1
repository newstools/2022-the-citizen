Speaking to TimesLIVE on Wednesday, Matthews said discipline issues were the reason behind the player being absent from training. “Sipho has been excused from training until further notice for disrespecting his teammates and the technical team,” said Matthews.Mbule was widely linked with Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns during the January transfer period, but a move from SuperSport failed to materialise.It is believed that the 24-year-old midfielder tried to force his way out of the club, but SuperSport decided to keep him and it is said that Mbule then decided to go on a go-slow at training.Meanwhile, SuperSport coach Kaitano Tembo reportedly refused to comment on Mbule when he was quizzed about the player’s whereabouts.“I don’t want to comment about Sipho Mbule. I think I will leave that to the management,” Tembo responded when asked by TimesLIVE why he was not at training.
