It might have been a slim score-line, but the clash between Simba SC and Orlando Pirates in the first leg of the Caf Confederation Cup quarter-finals provided a lot of drama following the outbursts between the two camps. ALSO READ: Simba ‘fear for their lives’ after Pirates coach Ncikazi’s post-match interview It started with Pirates coach Mandla Ncikazi complaining about the unfriendly and hostile environment they faced in Tanzania. Simba chief executive officer Barbara Gonzalez, however, denied Ncikazi’s claims and even went as far as saying that the Pirates coach’s outburst was due to the him being under pressure.Gonzalez then said her team would lodge a complaint to Caf against Ncikazi and Pirates. The gloves are certainly off, both outside the field and inside, which once again makes this tie one of the most highly anticipated quarter-final clashes. Simba coach, Pablo Franco Martin, says his team has to be focused because they have not done well in away games especially in the group stages.  “We need to be focused on being much more competitive in this competition. We didn’t when we played away games. From then on, we will see what plan we are going to develop,” said Martin. Ncikazi and co-coach Fadlu Davids, meanwhile, will also have to roll out a good strategy to beat their opponents and make sure they get to the semi-finals of the tournament. The Buccaneers have been decent in front of goals while playing at home despite their poor display in the first leg. The Soweto giants recorded five goals in the group stages games played at their own turf and this should be a morale booster for the team ahead of Sunday’s clash at the Orlando Stadium.
