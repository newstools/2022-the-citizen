He said they were not collecting goods from people all over the country as it was too much of a logistics and labour issue when instead Gift of the Givers could bulk buy in Durban and Pietermaritzburg at special discounts where it was buying containers and truckloads of goods it had identified that were needed. Funding is required to purchase certain basic things, said Sooliman, and asked people to rather donate cash.
