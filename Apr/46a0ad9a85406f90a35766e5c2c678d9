Former SA Schools and Junior Boks scrumhalf Sanele Nohamba has left the Sharks and joined the Lions. This was confirmed by the Sharks on Tuesday. Nohamba had fallen somewhat out of favour in Durban with Grant Williams and Jaden Hendrickse ahead of him in the No 9 queue. The 23-year-old, who went to Durban High School, made his Currie Cup debut in 2019, the same year he played five times for the SA Under-20 team at the Junior World Cup. Nohamba joined the Lions at training for the first time on Tuesday. He will compete with Morne van den Berg for a starting place, while Andre Warner is also on the Lions’ books. The Lions are next in action in the URC on Saturday when they take on Connacht at Ellis Park at 4pm.
