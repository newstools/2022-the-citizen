Western Cape Premier Alan Winde on Friday announced changes to his Cabinet following the resignation of Education MEC Debbie Schäfer. Schäfer announced on Thursday she would be bowing out of public life after 20 years in politics.  She is expected to vacate office from 15 May 2022 after she accepted a job offer in the legal sector in the UK. Schäfer was the Western Cape’s education MEC for the last eight years. At a press conference on Friday, Winde announced the appointment of Finance and Economic Opportunities MEC David Maynier as the new education MEC in the DA-run province. The premier also established dedicated departments for infrastructure and mobility, including filling a vacancy in the Department of Community Safety that was headed by Albert Fritz before he was fired in March over sexual misconduct allegations.   ALSO READ: Premier Alan Winde fires MEC Albert Fritz over sex pest claims The changes to the Western Cape Cabinet are as follows: Simmers, who was the MEC of Human Settlements since 2019, was appointed to lead the Department of Infrastructure.
