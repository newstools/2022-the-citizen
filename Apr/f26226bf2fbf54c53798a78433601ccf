Kaizer Chiefs captain Bernard Parker manned up and accepted that they should not have let their chance of challenging Mamelodi Sundowns for the DStv Premiership title slip.  While mathematically it is still possible for Chiefs to catch Sundowns, only a stubborn punter would put their money on it happening. Sundowns are just mean and in no mood for games as they cruise in every game.

Had they won the games, they would have cut Sundowns’ lead to a more reachable nine points.  But now going into their next match on Saturday against SuperSport at the same venue, they trail Masandawana by 18 points.  “It was very painful after the match,” says Parker of the defeat to Arrows. “It was so quiet (in the dressing room), we all felt the pain. We had dropped it… We dropped the points. We went into the match with so much confidence and we were shocked.  “I guess, as they say football will kill you and we have come to see that with that surprise. It was our fault and it is important for us now to grow stronger and take the defeat and turn it into motivation so we can finish strongly.”  Losing out on the league means another dry season for Amakhosi – an eighth in a row – and it is getting embarrassing for the club once known as the cup kings of local football.  “I feel (bad) for the players who have not got anything tangible like a medal in their career because when you are at Chiefs you know you will get something… But it has been a struggle in the past seven years,” said Parker.
