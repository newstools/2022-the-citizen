National Commissioner of the South African Police Service (Saps), General Fannie Masemola has asked his provincial counterpart in Gauteng to submit a report on the high profile arrest of Advocate Malesela Teffo. Teffo, who is currently representing four suspects accused of murdering soccer star Senzo Meyiwa, had just wrapped proceedings for the day when several heavily armed police officers clad in masks and black berets surrounded the cop-turned-lawyer and proceeded to arrest him. The officers had scant regard for the fact that Teffo had just wrapped up the day’s proceedings in the highly publicised murder trial and proceeded to arrest Teffo amid much fanfare in court, with television cameras still rolling, and a court gallery, some of whom filmed his arrest live on social media. During his arrest, he claimed the reason he was being put in cuffs was that Police Minister Bheki Cele didn’t want him on the case. Cele has since responded saying Teffo must present his case and evidence against the minister and whoever he believes is behind his arrest in the court of law. Cele has also a full report from Masemola, including an explanation for the manner in which the arrest was conducted. Teffo’s public arrest has raised suspicions that his less than warm relationship with Saps management had reached boiling point. Teffo has alleged that senior members of Saps tampered with Meyiwa’s crime scene. His clients, who are already serving jail time for other offences deny being in Vosloorus at the time of the murder. Teffo’s speciality is mostly labour law, in which he represents police officers who have been allegedly victimised by Saps management.
