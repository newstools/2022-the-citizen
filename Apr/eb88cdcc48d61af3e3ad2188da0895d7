Proteas captain Dean Elgar will be careful to not disturb a nasty cut on his forehead when he bats in the second Test against Bangladesh, starting in Gqeberha from Friday. Elgar is sporting a big cut and some bruising on his forehead following a slip in the shower in Durban on Monday night. According to reports the Proteas captain had some difficulty batting with a helmet following the incident. Elgar told AFP on Thursday: “I’ve got a few stitches in my forehead,” he said. “I batted today, it was going to be a concern with where my helmet rests.  “I don’t think I’m too far from where the doctor takes the stitches out. But I’m okay.” The Proteas won the first Test in Durban at the beginning of the week by 220 runs and will be favourites to make it 2-0 when the second Test starts on Friday.
