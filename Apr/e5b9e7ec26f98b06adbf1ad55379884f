Kaizer Chiefs have been thrown into a crisis and the club’s management will have to take a close look into the situation with the team losing its fourth game in a row on Saturday afternoon. ALSO READ: Ngcobo apologises, but could still be sanctioned by Chiefs Amakhosi went into Saturday’s DStv Premiership fixture against Cape Town City at FNB Stadium having last won on April 2. They have since drawn one and lost four as their campaign suffers further knocks.  City settled faster into the game and started dictating it, and showing a little more ambition going forward. Their efforts were rewarded in the 15th minute, benefitting from another defensive blunder on the Chiefs side.  Daniel Cardoso tried to play the ball with his head towards keeper Brandon Petersen but did not have a clean touch. And Craig Martin got to it first and sent it past the advancing Petersen to give City an early lead.  The goal saw Chiefs crawl out of their shell and they started stringing together some decent passes but could not find the right balls in the final third. City were happy to sit back and come out on a counter attack, which almost helped towards the end of the half. Mduduzi Mdantsane could not connect with a cross from the left.  It took City 15 minutes in the second half to get another goal. This time Terrence Mashego was allowed a free run inside the Amakhosi box, he went one-on-one with the keeper and beat him at his near post.  Dumisani Zuma, who was introduced towards the end of the game, scored Amakhosi’s complementary goals with just less than 10 minutes to the end. Chiefs remain in fifth position with their hopes of making the Caf competitions places highly diminished. City moved closer to second placed Royal AM with just one point now separating the two sides.
