President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday announced that all Covid-19 pandemic legal restrictions would end at midnight, declaring it was time to resume growing the economy. Ramaphosa said his country, which is the hardest hit on the continent, has seen death rates plunge from an average daily high of 420 in July last year to just 12 in the past week. Government “decided to terminate the national state of disaster with effect from midnight tonight” which has been in place since March 15, 2020, he said in a televised address. “We are hopeful that the worst is behind us, and  we are confident that there are only better days ahead. “Now is the time to grow our economy and create jobs… to get our country back on track.  “Now is the time to heal, to recover and to rebuild,” he said in a televised address to the nation.
