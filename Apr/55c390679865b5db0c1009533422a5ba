Where to start in talking about Saturday’s Derby day race meeting at Turffontein? There are so many highlights it’s not easy to single out one for prominence. The old journalism wheeze of bullet points is a way around the conundrum: Rain In Holland will have to suffer a major mishap to let the Tiara slip. She is bred to handle this 2450m and has looked increasingly comfortable as she has been stepped up in trip thus far. None of her regular opponents seems to have the capacity to turn around the form, while her new rivals don’t seem to be in the same class. There’s a huge weight of expectation on trainer Sean Tarry and jockey Richard Fourie, with the daughter of Duke Of Marmalade likely to be a banker in most exotic permutations, but the seasoned pros have the experience and temperament to make a little more history. Red Saxon won the 1800m SA Classic with a resolute performance over 1800m and is a clear ante-post favourite to take the Derby as well. But there are doubts about his stamina capacity over the extra 650m as his sire, Red Ray, was an out-and-out sprinter. A horse like Aragosta, once fancied as a Triple Crown candidate himself but who failed to land either of the first two legs of the series, looks a more likely winner in this final leg of the dead rubber. Mike de Kock’s runner has not met expectations thus far but has the ideal pedigree for such a test of endurance and class. Kommetdieding? The 1600m is perhaps a bit sharp for him nowadays, but the competitive spirit runs strong in his veins and a victory would be a showstopper.
