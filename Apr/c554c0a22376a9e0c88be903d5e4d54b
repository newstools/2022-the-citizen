Orlando Pirates Caf Confederation Cup campaign says a lot about the quality in the Bucs team, says former striker James Mothibi ahead of the Buccaneers quarter-final clash Tanzanian outfit Simba SC away from home on Sunday. The Soweto giants have reached the last eight of the continental tournament for the second season in a row, but their DStv Premiership season has not been as good as the Confed Cup, with the team’s chances of finishing the campaign in second place highly unlikely.

Bucs are in fourth place on the log after collecting 39 points in 25 games, four points behind second placed Royal AM. “Look, it’s been one hell of a season for the club, we have not been consistent, especially in the league. But, if you look at our Caf campaign, it has been good. We have done very well in Africa and I believe we can go all the way to lift that trophy.  We have to applaud the players, because it is not easy to play on the continent. But again, I believe we have a very good team, we have quality players, that is why we are doing well in Africa. We have to clap hands for the players,” said Mothibi. “So, we have to rally behind them, we have to show them love and support despite everything. If we can do that, I think they will perform to their level best and make sure that they lift the trophy. It’s the second season that we have reached the quarter-finals, I think that says a lot about Pirates. This might just be our year to win the Confederation Cup.” The Bucs former striker also wished Paseka Mako a speedy recovery after the left-back collided with goalkeeper Richard Ofori in their clash with Baroka FC last Tuesday. “He is a strong boy, he will be back in no time. That injury was unfortunate, and I wish him a speedy recovery. “I saw Ofori was really worried, I hope he also knows that it was a mistake, he didn’t mean to injure his teammate or any other player,” he added.
