Two suspects have been charged with two counts of murder, six counts of attempted murder and two counts of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, following a shooting at Chicken Farm informal settlement last Monday. The second murder charge stems from the death of one of their own. Tebogo Molapo, 29, and Mokhabi Ngoanapudi, 33, appeared at the Protea Magistrates’ Court on Monday in relation to the murder of Kgomotso Diale, who was fatally shot at Chicken Farm informal settlement.  Diale was shot when some residents of Pimville (Soweto) went to Chicken Farm to seek leads after their area was plunged into darkness as a result of suspected cable theft.  According to the NPA, Allegations are that three males alighted from a vehicle, armed with rifles and started shooting at the Pimville residents. Diale and four other people were injured, with Diale succumbing to the gunshot wounds. The duo was remanded in custody until 04 May 2022 for legal representation. According to Brigadier Brenda Muridili, the suspects were arrested on Thursday after police followed up on information about suspects in possession of firearms in Dlamini and Chiawelo, Soweto. “On arrival, the members surrounded the house and on entering, one of the members was pointed with a firearm by a suspect but acted swiftly and shot at the said suspect. Two more suspects were placed under arrest and two firearms and ammunition were seized by the police,” said Muridili. Preliminary investigation linked the arrested suspects to the shooting incident that occurred on Monday in Chicken Farm informal settlement where six people were shot.
