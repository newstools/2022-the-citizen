The jockey room at Kenilworth burst into applause on Queen’s Plate day in early January – not for the big race winner but for Bernard Fayd’Herbe having won a minor race on the day. Popular jockey “Bernie” had suffered an uncommon lean spell, and everyone was happy to see a talented rider bouncing back. The dam had surely broken. But it hadn’t. A grandson of famous jockey of yore Tiger Wright, Fayd’herbe is arguably the best heavyweight to have graced the South African turf. The winner of dozens of Grade 1s – including Julys and Mets – has shared glory with Pocket Power, What A Winter, Futura and scores more top horses. Inexplicably, Fayd’Herbe has continued to struggle in recent months. He hasn’t had a winner in 50 days now – a barely believable situation. Come Wednesday at Kenilworth; he is nicely teed up to smash the hoodoo. The breakthrough could come as early as the first race, in which he rides heavily fancied Star In Winter for trainer Dean Kannemeyer. If not, the second, partnering well-backed Marvel William for Vaughan Marshall. Then there’s the fourth, with Marshall’s Naushon looking a very tasty bet. Lucinda Woodruff-trained Island Treasure is at slightly longer odds in the fifth but has a fair shout in a competitive contest. Fayd’Herbe completes his day with two rides for Piet Botha, on Transact in the sixth and Gem King in the eighth, both capable of winning. Not long ago, we’d have been predicting three or four scalps at the meeting for the ace jock. Today, we’ll be happy with one or two – just to get that monkey off the poor bloke’s back.
