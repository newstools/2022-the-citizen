Springbok backline star Frans Steyn earned further respect from SA director of rugby Rassie Erasmus after downing a beer following a domestic match in Cape Town at the weekend. Steyn, whose career includes two Rugby World Cup titles and two series victories over the British and Irish Lions, stepped off the field after the Cheetahs’ Currie Cup match against the Cheetahs on Friday in order to accept a cup of ale from a spectator. The veteran player gave the fan a ‘cheers’ before downing the beer in a matter of seconds, to the delight of the crowd. Erasmus, the former Bok coach, reacted on social media by sharing a video of the light-hearted incident. The Cheetahs secured a 28-21 victory over Western Province in their Currie Cup fixture on Friday, climbing within just one point of the log-leading Bulls with a game in hand. Steyn is likely to be back on the field on May 6, in the Cheetahs’ next game against the Lions at Ellis Park.
