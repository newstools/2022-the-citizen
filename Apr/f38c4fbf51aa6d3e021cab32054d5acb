Springbok captain Siya Kolisi has sent a message to Springbok supporters following the conclusion of the first alignment camp held in Durban on Monday and Tuesday. Selected players from the Bulls, Lions, Sharks and Stormers joined the camp ahead of the international season, starting in July. The Boks play against Wales in three Tests in July before turning their attention to the Rugby Championship. “We just wrapped up camp, it was amazing,” says Kolisi in the video, posted by the Springboks.
