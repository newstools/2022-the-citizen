Mamelodi Sundowns were made to sweat in a 2-1 win over Royal AM to reach the final of the Nedbank Cup and will face Marumo Gallants as they look to sweep all of the top-flight trophies this season. ALSO READ: Gallants reach Cup final with hard-fought win over Limpopo rivals TTMThe Nedbank Cup final is seto to be played at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium on 28 May.    Sundowns were let down by the video assistant referee (VAR) in the Caf Champions League in both their games against Petro Atletico, as the technology played a huge role in Downs’ exit in the continent’s premium club competition. I’m certain that Masandawana coaches wished VAR was in place in their Nedbank Cup semifinal against Royal AM as they had a penalty shout around the 60th minute. Striker Pavol Safranko was fouled and the man in the middle, Victor Hlungwani ruled that the foul took place outside the box but in retrospect, the incident actually happened in the box and Downs were denied a clear penalty. The visitors lined up for the free-kick and Aubrey Modida made sure to make the most of the situation as he netted to give Downs the lead in the 63rd minute. However, Modiba attempt took a deflection on its way into Hugo Nyame’s net. Thwahla Thwihli then got the equalizer in the 73rd minute through veteran winger Thabo Matlaba, who beat Downs captain Denis Onyango. However, the Masandawana made sure to keep their hopes of a domestic treble alive as they scored the winner in the 76th minute and thanks to Nyame, who played a one-two with Mbhazima Rikhotso from the goal-kick, giving the energetic Peter Shalulie all the space to press him and the Namibian won the ball. He then laid it on to Safranko, who netted before going down after taking a knock. The Slovakian was kicked on the knee and immediately went down before the ball could hit the back of the net. He had to be stretchered out just like Brain Onyango, who also took a knock on his knee in the first stanza.
