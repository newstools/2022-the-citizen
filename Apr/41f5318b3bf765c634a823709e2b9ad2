Just because they beat Arrows 6-0 doesn’t mean it will happen to us as well. I have been receiving a lot of calls from people telling me that our journey in the Nedbank Cup is over,” said Mama-Joy. “What I want to say is that Royal AM is a big team, we are ambitious and we want to win the Nedbank Cup. Sundowns or any other team won’t stop us from achieving our goal. We know what we want as fans and the players also know what they want. We are underdogs going into this game, so, there is really no pressure for us, we know that people think that Sundowns will just walk past us, but, it won’t be like that. We are going to beat them. We are not going to be scared, we know that they are a good side and they have quality players, but we also have quality in our team. That is why we are number two in the league, it’s not by chance.” Royal AM have been impressive this season, with the club currently occupying second spot on the league table having collected 43 points in 24 games. The dates and venues for the semi-finals of the Ke Yona Cup will be announced in due course.
