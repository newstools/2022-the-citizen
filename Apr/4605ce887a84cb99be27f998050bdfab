While it may be acceptable to win the DStv Premiership with distinction, the bigger fish is the Caf Champions League and Mamelodi Sundowns winger Lyle Lakay says if Downs don’t get their second ‘holy grail’ this season, they would have failed the Masandawana faithful. WATCH: Sundowns’ advice to Pirates over Simba row Sundowns find themselves in a situation where they need to overturn a 2-1 first-leg loss to Angolan side Petro Atletico, who they face on Saturday at FNB Stadium.

We have to be very wary of their breaks but at the end of the day, if we stick to our game, we will be victorious,” he added. Lakay and his teammates will be banking on the backing of their supporters, who were invited to watch the team train at their Chloorkop base on Thursday morning – the club are giving away tickets to the match in an attempt to get as many bums on seats as possible. “It is very important to have the 12th man. As much as it encourages us, it makes the environment a bit hostile for the away team. It is very important for us and I hope the supporters come to the game. We’ve seen the work that the work the club has been putting in with the regards to the supporters coming the stadium and I hope we will have a full house,” said Lakay. Under government regulations, FNB Stadium is allowed to be filled to half its capacity.
