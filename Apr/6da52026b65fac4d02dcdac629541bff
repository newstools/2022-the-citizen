Dinesh Karthik smashed an unbeaten 66 to set up a convincing 16-run victory for Royal Challengers Bangalore in their Indian Premier League match against Delhi Capitals on Saturday. The in-form Karthik steered Bangalore to 189 for five with his 34-ball knock after Glenn Maxwell’s breezy 55 in the second match of the day in Mumbai. Delhi, who are still searching for their maiden Indian Premier League title, could only muster 173-7 despite a 38-ball 66 from David Warner. Karthik, a wicketkeeper-batter, stood out as he put on an unbeaten stand of 97 for the sixth wicket with Shahbaz Ahmed, who hit 32, as Bangalore plundered 69 runs from the last four overs. He made full use of a dropped catch on five to tear into the opposition attack in the final 18 balls and smashed Mustafizur Rahman for four fours and two sixes in a 28-run 18th over.
