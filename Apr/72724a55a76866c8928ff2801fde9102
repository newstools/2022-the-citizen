A useful service to punters is the trainer comments about first-timers and rested horses carried in the Computaform guide. One just wishes there weren’t so many “No comment given” notes. Could the callers not try a bit harder to contact said trainers or their assistants? In Computaform for Wednesday’s Kenilworth meeting, ace trainer Justin Snaith is enthusiastic about two of his juveniles making their first trip to the races for 1000m blow-outs. On filly Ciao Bella in Race 2, he informs us: “Smart filly. Will go close on debut.” And colt Cider House Rules in Race 3 elicits: “Plenty of speed and will be right in the shake-up on debut.” From the horse’s mouth. You couldn’t ask for much more in the way of transparency and inside info. Snaith’s observations about his other runners in these races are also nuggets. “Nice filly and could well run a place on debut,” he says of Turn The Page in the second. “Nice type but looking for a mile. One to follow,” is the verdict on Betty Boop in the same race. You balance these opinions against those of other trainers, alongside the form of runners with some experience, and come to the conclusion that Ciao Bella and Cider House Rules might be worth a minor flutter.
