Advocate Malesela Teffo, who is representing four of the suspects in the Senzo Meyiwa murder trial has been granted bail of R10 000 on Friday by the Hillbrow magistrate’s court. This comes after he was arrested on Thursday afternoon as court proceedings in the murder trial adjourned for the day. Teffo was arrested because he had missed a previous court appearance. During his arrest, claimed the reason Teffo claimed he was being put in cuffs was that Police Minister Bheki Cele didn’t want him on the case.

He recently took on two high profile criminal matters in which he alleges that police and politicians are complicit in charging the wrong people, ie: his clients. The publication reports that most of Teffo’s legal work is in the labour law field, and that he is particularly well qualified to assist victimised police members. “Prior to qualifying as a lawyer and becoming an advocate, he had been well trained as a recruit in the post-1994 SAPS.” City Press also reports that Teffo was arrested twice within a space of two weeks in November 2021. Teffo was initially arrested on a charge of contempt of court and was released after paying bail. The publication reported that the charge was in connection with his alleged failure to appear before the court in a labour-related matter. While the state suggested setting bail at R5000, the magistrate said it must be considered that this is Teffo’s second warrant of arrest. The matter has been postponed to 27 May 2022.
