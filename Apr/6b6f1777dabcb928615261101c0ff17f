Sipho Mbule’s omission at SuperSport United is nothing, but a plot to demoralize the player, claims a source close to the midfielder. Mbule hasn’t featured for United in a while now and recently, the club’s CEO Stan Matthews labelled him as disrespectful. The former South African nation team junior player is in his last months on his contract with Matsatsantsa and offers are said to have put on the table for the midfield maestro, with Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs believed to be the front runners for his signature.

The source has revealed that Mbule has not been playing because he is yet to sign a contract extension with SuperSport and the club don’t want to lose him for free. The club sidelining him has left him to be very angry with the situation and he doesn’t understand why he is being treated this way. “The situation is really bad, you should see him every time the club is playing, it’s really sad. He loves SuperSport because that is the club that made him, but what he doesn’t understand is that they always knew that he wanted to leave and he was told his wish would be granted. “He is just puzzled by what is happening at the moment. He was training and doing everything that is required of him like he always does, he just got shocked a couple of weeks ago when he was sidelined for one of the games. “That’s when the problem started because he wasn’t really given any explanation for his exclusion only to find out later that it is because of his decision not to sign a contract. Now the club is saying that he is a bad boy, disrespectful and all of those things which are not true. “Some of the players are not happy with Mbule’s situation because he is one of the influential players at the club, but they are scared to talk,”
