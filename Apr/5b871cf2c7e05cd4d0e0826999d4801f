Chippa United are slowly climbing up the table in their mission to get out of the relegation zone and caretaker coach Kurt Lentjies says at this stage of the season, it doesn’t matter how one get to win games.ALSO READ: Rejuvenated AmaZulu eyeing Champions League spot This is after the Chili Boys edged Stellenbosch FC 1-0 in the DStv Premiership tie at the Nelson Mandela bay Stadium last Sunday, with Sammy Seabi goal being the difference between the sides. Lentjies credited the win to the return of their home fans to the stadium following the lifting of lockdown restrictions.   “Obviously three points, I think we waited for the supporters to come back before we started winning at home,” Lentjies joked. “But, it was a much needed three points and onto the next one. But, my thoughts on the game, I was not happy with the first 45 minutes, hence the changes we made tactically and the personnel in half-time. It got better in stages. But to be honest, I can say the best team actually lost today. They had a couple of chances and our goalkeeper made saves,” he added. “From a playing point of view, they were much more structured than us. They are not in position five or four (Stellies are in sixth place) for no reason, they are there for a reason. But I mean, they did well. On other days we play fantastically well and walk away with absolutely nothing. We played poorly and we got three points. But, if you’re at the bottom you accept the points just the way they come.” Chippa are now in 12th spot on the league table with 25 points going into their last five fixtures of the season.
