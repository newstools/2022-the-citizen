Orlando Pirates are said to be on the verge of losing promising winger Tebogo Tlolane, who was nicknamed “Messi” upon his arrival in the professional ranks because of his skills and pace, especially while playing at Jomo Cosmos. According to a source close to the player, ‘Messi’ is seen as waste of talent at Pirates and his lack of game time might kill his promising career.

But, that’s what happens with every coach, they like him, they see what he is capable of doing, but they still don’t play him. “So, now, he will surely be leaving the team at the of the end season, that’s what I know and that is something that he is also looking. It’s demoralizing for a player like him to be warming the bench the entire season, it’s really strange and embarrassing. “So, now he is just a member of the Pirates team, we just see him with the branded clothes and all of those things, but, he is not playing. I know what he is capable of and I think everyone at the club knows, I just wonder why he is not playing. “Maybe there is something he has done and he is not telling us as people who are close to him. But, either way, there are teams that want him and I really can’t wait for the end of the season to see him leave Pirates,” said the source.
