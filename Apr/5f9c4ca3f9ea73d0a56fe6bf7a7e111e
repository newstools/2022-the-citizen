Following their loss against Netherlands, Banyana Banyana goalkeeper Andile Dlamini says the match was a good lesson for the team and a sign that there is still so much work that needs to be done. Dlamini was in goals for Banyana as they lost 5-1 to the Netherlands in their international friendly at Kyocera Stadium on Wednesday, but was later replaced by Kaylin Swart.

But, Netherlands are a very good team, they have a good squad and you can see their quality in the way they play. They are very disciplined and they are united, they play for each other, I think those are some of the things that make them very good,” said the shot-stopper. “But, we played well, I think we gave it our best shot and the match will be taken as a lesson, there is no doubt about that. It will help us to grow as a team and this loss wont demoralise us.  We have to keep our heads high and keep on moving.” With the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations coming up in July in Cameroon, Dlamini seems to think their loss to the Netherlands was a wake-up call to the team and there is still a lot that need to improve. “We have the Afcon tournament coming up, we have to be very prepared because we know that the country is behind us and everyone wants to see us doing good. But, I believe we will be ready and we will go to Cameroon with only on one thing in our minds, which is to win the tournament, but, we also know that it won’t be easy.”
