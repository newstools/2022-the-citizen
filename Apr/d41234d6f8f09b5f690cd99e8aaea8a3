Dramatic scenes unfolded just as court proceedings in the Senza Meyiwa murder trial adjourned on Thursday. Police arrived at the courtroom to arrest advocate Malesela Teffo, who is representing four of the suspects in the murder trial. It’s understood that Teffo is being arrested because he had missed a previous court appearance. Court had adjourned for a month and will resume on 30 May. Sifisokuhle Ntuli, Muzikawukhulelwa Sthemba Sibiya, Bongani Sandiso Ntanzi, Mthobisi Prince Ncube, and Mthokoziseni Ziphozonke Maphisa who are charged with murdering the Bafana Bafana captain in Vosloorus in 2014, will remain behind bars until the next appearance. The suspects are already serving various sentences for convictions in other unrelated cases. Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela warned the witness Sergeant Thabo Mosia, who is currently on the stand, that he is not to discuss details of the case with anyone while the court is in recess. Mosia was being grilled by Teffo who is representing four of the suspects, Sibiya, Ntanzi and Ncube, and Mapisa, all of whom deny ever being at the crime scene before the 26 October 2014 murder. Mosia’s time in the witness box has been less than pleasant, with several objections raised about Teffo’s line of questioning. When the court resumes in May, the cross-examination will continue, this time by advocate Zandile Mshololo, representing the fifth accused, Ntuli.
