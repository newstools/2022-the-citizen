After celebrating the end of season 2 of The Real Housewives of Durban, South African songwriter, singer and model Londiwe ‘Londie London’ Zulu hosted an event to celebrate a milestone birthday in style. The singer celebrated her 30th birthday over the long weekend with a fancy high tea party which was attended by her closest friends and family.  The celebrations took place at Sammy Sweet Bakery where Andimahle Building Events got the chance to transform the space with beautiful and bright coloured flowers, different shades of pink balloons, and other lavish birthday props which fit the pink high tea theme.  The birthday girl wore an adorable pink cocktail dress which she styled with multicoloured pump heels. Taking to social media, the singer shared a series of photographs from the celebration which showed her birthday outfit, the events decor, as well as Londie’s guests who all dressed for the occasion.  “Thank you again to each and everyone one of you for celebrating a beginning to a new decade with me. To my friends that couldn’t make it and sent gifts and messages- I love & appreciate you so much,” said Zulu in the caption of one of her posts. Some public figures who were spotted at the high tea were Kefilwe Mabote, Lasizwe, Cici Worldwide, Miss Pru, and Lerato Sengadi.

The 30-year-old singer joined the cast for season 2 of the reality television show, which came to a dramatic end last week Thursday when the ladies decided to confront LaConco about her mystery partner which she has chosen to keep a secret, at a party hosted by Annie in Sun City.
