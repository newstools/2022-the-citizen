Kaizer Chiefs defender Njabulo Ngcobo has issued a public apology for the tantrum he threw on Wednesday. ALSO READ: Chiefs infuriated by Ngcobo’s unprofessional conductNgcobo had a bad game and made a costly mistake and refused to shake coach Arthur Zwane’s hand when he was taken off. He went on to have a run-in with goalkeeper coach Lee Baxter who tried to turn him back to go and shake Zwane’s hand. “I would like to sincerely apologise to coach Arthur Zwane, coach Dillon Sheppard, coach Lee Baxter, my teammates,  Kaizer Chiefs management and all Amakhosi supporters for not shaking the coach’s hand and for the outburst that followed after being taken off. I take full responsibility for my actions and such should not be repeated.  “I am not proud of what I did. It was a heat of the moment thing because I made some costly mistakes during the match. It’s not nice knowing that you’ve let the team down as a player. But that does not justify any of my actions. I promise to do better in the future.” Chiefs said the matter would still be dealt with within the right structures in the club. This means he could still be fined or suspended from club activities.
