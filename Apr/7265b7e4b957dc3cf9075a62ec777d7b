President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Wednesday evening, 06 April 2022, address the launch of the Oxford Handbook of the South African Economy. The President is expected to launch the book at a virtual event co-hosted by the Universities of the Witwatersrand and Johannesburg. Leading academics, economists, anthropologists and scientists including Presidential Economic Advisory Council members collaborated to produce a voluminous study of the structure of the South African economy in its varied sectors and industries. The 47-chapter Handbook of the South African Economy, Printed by the Oxford University Press, outlines the country’s history, political economy and key challenges. The publication also profiles such sectors and issues such as energy, the environment, trade, industry, regulation, the labour market, income distribution, social policy and the macroeconomy. “The Handbook of the South African Economy offers diverse analytical perspectives and debates that have implications for policymakers in the current climate of constrained economic growth in a Covid-19 pandemic era, weak economic transformation and the challenges of inequality and unemployment,” said the Presidency in a statement. The launch of the Handbook will be streamed on all Presidency and government digital platforms.
