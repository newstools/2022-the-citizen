When prominent South African football and Royal AM supporter Joy ‘Mama-Joy’ Chauke went to the Orlando Pirates game against Chippa United at the Orlando Stadium on Wednesday, she just wanted to enjoy herself and sing along with the fans, but it turned out to be a different story.  The former Pirates “super fan”, who switched her allegiance  to Royal AM prior to the start of the season, was booed by the Bucs’ supporters, as they chanted a song about her calling her a “liar”.   “I was shocked when I went to the Pirates game and I got booed by fellow supporters. It was the first time that I have experienced this, to be that person who gets booed. Normally, what happens is that supporters will boo players, but me, I don’t know what I have done to be booed by Pirates supporters,” said the distraught Mama-Joy.  “I am still shocked and I don’t know what to say. But what they have done is not acceptable. They have to respect me and understand that I have chosen Royal AM. And I always go to the stadium because since we are faced with this virus (Covid-19), when you have been vaccinated you can attend any game you want. “I never thought going to Orlando Stadium would end up with me getting booed, but I just joined them when they sang Mama Joy o le menemene (Mama-Joy you’re a liar). I was there to sing and dance with supporters. I attended the Mamelodi Sundowns game when they were playing the Caf game and I didn’t get booed. But after the game, they came to me and took pictures with me and I didn’t say no. And some were saying they love me and they want me to come back (to Pirates), but I am a Royal AM supporter now.” Chauke says Pirates fans need to accept her decision that she is now a Twihli Thwahla supporter and they have to respect her as a fellow football fan, who loves going to the stadiums.
