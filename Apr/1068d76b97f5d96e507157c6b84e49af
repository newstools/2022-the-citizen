Brazil announced on Sunday it will “in the coming days” lift public health emergency measures in place for over two years, citing a drop in the number of Covid-19 deaths and infections. More than 660,000 people died of the virus in Brazil, one of the hardest-hit countries second only to the United States. But the number of infections and deaths has fallen dramatically as authorities ramped up immunisation, with about 75% of its 212 million people now fully vaccinated.

We will continue to live with the virus,” the minister said.  The decision came after Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, who famously dismissed the virus as “a little flu”, asked his minister a few weeks ago to decree an “end to the pandemic” and called for a return to normalcy.
