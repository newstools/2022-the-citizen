As TS Galaxy prepare for their DStv Premiership clash with Orlando Pirates at the Mbombela Stadium on Monday, Rockets defender Pogiso Sanoka says the team has improved their defence. ALSO READ: Mama Joy – Orlando Pirates supporters need to respect me Sanoka believes the club’s shaky rearguard in the first round of the campaign contributed to the team’s poor results, which currently sees them fighting to save their top flight status. Galaxy are in 15th spot on the league standings with 20 points after 26 games. “It is always difficult in the second round of the season, where you see your team at the bottom of the log. You play one game, you win, you go on to lose two games and you lose your momentum and you have to start afresh. “At the same time, we are dealing with a lot of youngsters in our team … I don’t think they have been in this situation before. So, for us as senior players, we have to step up and show them the right direction. But, so far the preparations have been going very well,” said the Galaxy defender. “I think if you … go back and look at our games, especially in the first round of the season, there were many changes in … our last line of defence. You would play with one player this weekend, next weekend he is suspended and you have to try and make a combination with another player. But, it’s better now because with the current back four, we have been playing together for the last five or six games.” The Rockets face a Pirates side that come from a disappointing goalless draw with Chippa United last Wednesday. Pirates will definitely be looking to get back to winning ways against a struggling Galaxy team, but, it surely won’t be easy for the Bucs, with the Mpumalanga based club eager to get out of the relegation zone.  Sanoka and company played to a 1-1 draw with Maritzburg United in their previous game.
