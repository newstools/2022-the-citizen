I am not saying that he is not contributing at the club, he is doing a lot, even outside the field, he guides the youngsters. “But, the team will offer him something, a one year extension at least because his contract is expiring in June. It will be a matter of whether he likes what he is being offered or not, if not, he has no choice but to leave because I think he was considering ending his career should he not get a new contract. “But, I am sure the coach would like him to stay, they have worked together before and they have a very good understanding with each other,” the source revealed.
