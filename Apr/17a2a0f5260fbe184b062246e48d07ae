A rocket attack killed at least 35 people on Friday on a train station in Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine that was being used for civilian evacuations, a rescue worker told AFP. AFP journalists on the scene saw at least 20 bodies of people grouped and lying under plastic sheets next to the station. Blood was pooling on the ground and packed bags were strewn outside the building in the immediate aftermath of the attack. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

Bodies were later seen being loaded onto a military truck. The head of Ukraine’s railway company, Alexander Kamyshin, wrote on social media earlier that “more than 30 people were killed and over 100 were injured” in the attack on the station.

Kramatorsk was hit by Russian strikes earlier this week but had otherwise largely been spared the destruction witnessed by other east Ukraine cities since Russia’s invasion. Ukrainian authorities warned residents in the east of the country to flee westwards immediately in advance of an anticipated Russian attack.
