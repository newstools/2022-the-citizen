A former Orlando Pirates and Platinum Stars midfielder Roger Majafa has resurfaced at ABC Motsepe League side Mucasa FC in Limpopo. Majafa, who has been in the wilderness since his departure at Pirates in 2016, hasn’t been able to find a suitable club with the midfielder having had short stints with the likes of TS Sporting. According to a source, the 32-years old is on a mission to revive his career and being at the third division side has helped him to focus and continue doing what he does best, which is playing football. “I know a lot of people have been asking about his whereabouts because he has been off the spotlight for quite a long time. The good thing is that he never stopped playing, he has been very active playing in the amateur tournaments. “Every time he was playing people would always ask themselves why he doesn’t have a team. I think it was just a matter of luck on his side because he is one of the talented players and he works very hard. “He even had some trials overseas and he impressed, unfortunately, Covid-19 came and that disrupted the move. We would be talking about something else now had it not been for that virus. But, what is done is done, he is playing now and he is happy because that’s what he loves to do, playing football. “Maybe something better will come up soon for him because he has been very brilliant,” said the source.
