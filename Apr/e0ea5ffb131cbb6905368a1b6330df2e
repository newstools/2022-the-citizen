The South African audience loves television weddings and one of the most popular telenovelas, The Queen on Mzansi Magic did theirs in grand style.  From The River and Legacy SA to Uzalo and Gomora, the ratings of these soapies skyrocket when it comes to a characters’ nuptials.  It was no different for The Queen, as the show trended on Monday evening, well into Tuesday morning as the audience watched Harriet Khoza played by Connie Ferguson and Hector Sebata (Rapulana Seiphemo) tie the knot in a glamorous ceremony.  Once arch-enemies, their budding romance took fans by surprise but the bigger plot twist is that Hector was married and left his pregnant wife Vuyiswa, a police detective played by Zandile Msutwana, for Harriet. Vuyiswa and Harriet are enemies as the detective has tried for numerous years to pin down Harriet’s drug business and the murders she is linked to.  Harriet is also responsible for the death of Hector’s daughter Thando who was played by Ntando Duma.  Despite all this drama, Hector chose Harriet.  The wedding was shot in the stunning location of Avianto in Muldersdrift, Johannesburg.  Harriet’s gorgeous gown was designed by Biji – La Maison de Couture, the same designer who made former Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi’s iconic custom Xhosa look for her final walk in the pageant.  There was once again a merger between The Queen and The River on 1 Magic, as Harriet’s friend Lindiwe, played by award-winning actress Sindi Dlathu, attended the wedding.  There was also a performance from Lira, as Harriet and Hector’s children watched on.  Viewers flocked to Twitter to applaud the production of the wedding, the dress and how Ferguson Films co-founder, the late Shona Ferguson, would be so proud. It was announced in March,that The Queen will be discontinued.  DStv confirmed reports of the show’s cancellation, with the final season to be aired in March 2023.
