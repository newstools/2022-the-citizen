Several reports have emerged that Kaizer Chiefs have pulled the plug on Stuart Baxter’s regime at Naturena.

Phakaaathi tried to get a confirmation from Chiefs and also his agent, but the phones rang unanswered. Baxter’s firing comes days after the club lost at home to SuperSport United, a result that dented their chances of finishing in the top two of the DStv Premiership. With fans booing after the game, Baxter offered to step down. It is not clear if the club accepted the offer or if they decided to pull the plug after realising that Amakhosi will yet again finish the season without a trophy. Baxter rejoined Chiefs towards the end of last season after the club had parted ways with coach Gavin Hunt, who despite having limited resources at his disposal led Amakhosi to the semifinals of the Caf Champions League.
