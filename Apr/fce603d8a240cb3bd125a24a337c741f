Amashukeli from Georgia will referee the Incoming Series opener in Pretoria on 2 July, which will be his first Test outside of Europe, while Gardner (Australia) was appointed for the second Test (9 July in Bloemfontein), and Carley (England) has been handed the final clash (16 July in Cape Town). Peyper has been appointed to referee the second Test between the All Blacks and Ireland (9 July), where Van der Westhuizen will be the TMO, two weeks after Jacobs will referee the Test between Chile and Scotland on 25 June. Jonker will be heading west on Television Match Official duty in the USA on the first three Saturdays in July. He will start in Argentina, when the Pumas host Scotland in San Salvador (2 July), followed by the two Rugby World Cup qualifiers between Chile and the USA, in Chile (9 July), and a week later in Glendale, Colorado in the USA (16 July). South Africa will also have two referees on the panel for the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England from 29-31 July, following the inclusion of Morné Ferreira and Ashleigh Murray-Pretorius on the team of match officials for this four-yearly event.
