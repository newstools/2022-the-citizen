Malaysian auto giant Proton announced its return to South Africa later this year following a short spell and subsequent quiet a decade ago. According to theedgemarkets.com, Malaysia’s biggest automaker has signed an agreement with Combined Motor Holdings (CMH) to relaunch itself in September spearheaded by two SUVs; the X50 and X70 with the Saga sedan following later. The surprise decision to return to South Africa where it previously offered the Gen.2 hatch and its Persona sedan equivalent, the Nissan NP200-rivalling Arena, Satria Neo and Saga comes on the back of Chery’s return last year with a line-up completely different from the models it arrived with also over a decade ago. South Africa’s inclusion will bring Proton’s export market count to 14 with the brand’s models already available on the African continent following the opening of a factory in Kenya using complete knockdown kits (CKD) of the Saga. “Proton’s long-term goals require exports to play a major role to grow the company’s overall sales as total industry volume in Malaysia is expected to remain flat,” Proton’s Director for International Sales, Steven Xu, was quoted as saying. “So, we are exploiting the strength of our new products, our brand and even the links Malaysia has with other countries to establish a foothold in many new markets. This is then bolstered by establishing knock-down (local assembly) operations where possible, which also helps to grow local economies”. Introduced two years ago, the X50 is the result of Proton’s acquiring by Volvo’s parent company, Geely, in 2017, which resulted in its Binyue, revealed in 2018, being badged X50. Based on Geely’s B-segment Modular Architecture (BMA), which reportedly has no links to Volvo’s CMA that underpins the XC40, the X50, in Malaysia, does come with Volvo input underneath its bonnet, namely the 1.5-litre three-cylinder turbo-petrol in two states of tune; 110kW/226Nm and 130kW/255Nm in T-GDI guise. The sole transmission available is a seven-speed dual-clutch with drive going to the front wheels only. Measuring 4 330 mm in overall length, the X50 has a wheelbase of 2 600 mm, stands 1 609 mm tall and has a width of 1 800 mm. Claimed boot capacity is 330-litres with the rear seats up. Notable specification items include a eight-inch or 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, between four and six-speakers for the sound system, LED headlights and remote control engine start, a panoramic sunroof, Hill Descent Control, Lane Departure Warning, Lane Keep Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control, all around parking sensors, a surround-view camera system and Park Assist to name but a few. Pricing kicks-off at RM79 200 (R289 656) before topping out at RM103 300 (R377 796), but expect a theoretical starting sticker of between R320 000 to R350 000 once sales begin. At the higher-end of the spectrum, the X70, which tops Proton’s line-up outright, is another rebadged Geely product, this time the Boyue that went on sale in China six years ago. Based on Geely’s NL platform, the X70 measures 4 519 mm in overall length with its wheelbase stretching 2 670 mm.  Standing 1 694 mm tall and measuring 1 831 mm wide, the X70, like the X50, provides seating for five with a claimed boot capacity of 515-litres with the rear seats up. Underneath the bonnet, a single engine is offered in Malaysia; a 1.8-litre turbo-petrol that produces 135kW/300Nm. A seven-speed dual-clutch is the sole transmission option with drive going to the front wheels as well. Depending on the trim level, specification items include 17, 18 or 19-inch alloy wheels, front and rear parking sensors, dual-zone climate control, an eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system, electric tailgate, an up to nine-speaker sound system, surround-view camera system, Nappa leather seats, Adaptive Cruise Control, Autonomous Emergency Braking, Auto High Beam Assist and Lane Departure Warning. In terms of pricing, the X70 range retails from RM94 800 (R346 709) to RM122 800 (R 449 113), though chances are that the starting sticker will be closer to R390 000 or even R400 000 once in South Africa. Expect clearer details to become available before the September relaunch. Additional details from paultan.org, carbase.my and wapcar.my
