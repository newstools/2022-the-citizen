Sead Ramovic uses fairness in his team selections and if a player does not show him he wants to play, then he leaves them out. That is what the Serbian mentor told journalists on Tuesday when asked why Ethan Brook had become a bit-part player this season.  The 21-year-old Brooks gets regular Bafana Bafana call-ups and there are worries that the limited game time at the Rockets may affect his chances in the future.

He even invited Bafana coach Hugo Broos to come to their training sessions to witness it for themselves.  “You know if you train with the players everyday, then you know exactly what I would like you to do. The national team coach can come to the training and watch, and then we can talk about it.  “But in the end I just let the players that I believe will help us win games play. I said it before, and I will say it again, everybody in my team, in my squad is welcome to show me everyday at training that he would like to play. And in the end we will see what will come out,” said Ramovic.
