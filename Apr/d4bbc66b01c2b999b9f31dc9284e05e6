I’m not going to talk about sources, blame others for a discussion that was started etc because at the end of the day I made the decision to draft that tweet, press send and put that out with my name on it,” he wrote.He apologised to all parties involved and stated that he was ready to accept the consequences of his actions as well as those of the tweets he sent and the harm it caused.“I have no excuse for it, I’ve been too wrapped up in Twitter drama and unfortunately leaned into being messy as a brand which is something, going forward, I’m going to move away from.”  Louis Pisano concluded by stating that he was going to take some time away from Twitter to figure out what this move would look like for him and think about how he would use his platforms for good moving forward.He apologised again at the end of his statement which led Twitter users to believe that he had received legal communication from Rihanna’s camp and the representatives of either A$ap Rocky and Amina Muaddi. Last week, Louis Pisano sent the worlds of celebrity news and pop culture into a frenzy after tweeting as though he had it on good authority that Rihanna and A$ap Rocky had broken up.  He attributed the break up to infidelity of A$ap Rocky’s part and fingered Muaddi as his mistress.  Curiosity about who she is spiked after rumours that rapper A$Ap Rocky cheated on Rihanna with Amina.  According to Google trends data, there had been over 50,000 searches for Amina Muaddi as of Thursday in South Africa alone.
