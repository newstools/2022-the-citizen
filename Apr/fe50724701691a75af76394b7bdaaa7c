One of the things players talk about when they join the big clubs in South Africa, particularly Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs, is playing in front of big crowds. This has however not happened for the past two years and the players who joined in that period have not had the experience. One of such is Chiefs defender Austin Dube who will get his first taste of playing in front of a big crowd on Saturday. That is if Dube makes Stuart Baxter’s team to face SuperSport United at FNB Stadium.

So, with them being there it will be a bit of an advantage for us. We urge them to come in numbers, we are expecting them there,” he added. Dube also urged the supporters to get vaccinated so things can get back to normal quicker and they can come to the stadiums without the strict restrictions. On facing Matsatsantsa a Pitori, he said: “We have been preparing very well for the game on Saturday. We have done great at training. “We played SuperSport in the first round and we know how they play in the same way they know us. But the focus is not on them, it is on improving on our side coming from the previous game.” He says they are working hard to ensure a strong finish by winning their remaining games. “For now, the focus is on the remaining games, we have been talking about them and we want to go all out and win all of them. That is possible and that is what we are working towards.”
