Electricity has finally been restored to all the residents who were affected by the fire at the Eldorado substation, south of Johannesburg. According to City Power, Eldorado Park Ext 7, 5, 2, 4, Freedom Park, and parts of Devland were switched on in the early hours of Saturday. The switch-on faced a number of challenges which left residents without electricity for almost a week. The Eldorado Park substation was gutted by fire on Easter Friday plunging several areas into darkness.

City Power will continue tracing and repairing the faults to ensure electricity is restored, he said. “We also suspect more localised faults due to theft and vandalism that will affect individual customers in Eldorado Park. The area was plagued by theft and vandalism of electricity infrastructure during the downtime.” City Power has apologised for the inconvenience the fire that left residents without electricity during the Holy month of Ramadan and Easter weekend. Last week, Mayor Mpho Phalatse said the fire was a deliberate act of sabotage. Phalatse instructed the city’s group forensic and investigation services unit to accelerate the rollout of a strategy to stop attacks on the city’s economic infrastructure.
