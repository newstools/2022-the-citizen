BEST BET RACE 2 SWINGER: 4-FUTURE TURN AND 6 PIROSHKA This is not the strongest of fields and these two runners stand out as the pair with the best exposed form. On paper they should fight it out and it would come as a surprise if both failed to finish in the first three. VALUE BET RACE 9 QUARTET: BOX 1, 5, 7, 9, 10 This these are he only runners with any form in this race and as the form is really exposed so no major upsets look likely. We have included No 9 Global Forest as an outsider as he ran some decent races over further earlier in his career and the stable is running into form.
