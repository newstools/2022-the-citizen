The three along with Kingsley’s son, Ross Holgate, delivered food parcels to an early childhood development centre in Thembisa, Johannesburg. Lira and Habana are Land Rover ambassador’s, along with the 76-year-old explorer. “It’s a privilege to use my role as a Land Rover ambassador to give back, and I’m honoured to have joined Kingsley and his team for part of his latest expedition,” former Springbok player, Habana said on Monday. Holgate aims to deliver at least 2 million meals in South Africa.
