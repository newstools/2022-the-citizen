South Africa’s very own DJ Black Coffee, real name Nkosinathi Maphumulo, has bagged his first Grammy Award on Sunday evening, for the best dance/electronic album category, with his 2021 LP, Subconsciously. This is the first time a South African producer has won or been nominated in this category. DJ Black Coffee shared this special moment with his first-born son, both taking to the stage in crisp white suits to accept the award.

The award-winning artist also thanked his album collaborators, including Pharrell and David Guetta, who Black Coffee says “believed in working with a smaller artist like myself and trusting me and trusting my ear.”  Other artists who appear on Subconsciously include Sabrina Claudio, Usher, and Diplo. As could be expected, South Africans took to social media in the early hours of Monday morning to congratulate the DJ and producer on this major milestone. Jazzman and bandleader Jon Batiste led the night with five awards, including Album of the Year. Retro act Silk Sonic – the group project of Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak – won four awards, including Record and Song of the Year. Pop sensation Olivia Rodrigo was named Best New Artist.
