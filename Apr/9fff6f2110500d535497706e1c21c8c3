New Proteas batter Ryan Rickelton has admitted excitement got to him in his first Test innings for South Africa against Bangladesh in Durban last week. The 25-year-old left-hander, who is also an accomplished wicketkeeper, hit a bright 21 in the first innings, boldly getting off the mark with a reverse-sweep for four, before he mistimed a pull shot off fast bowler Ebadot Hossain and looped a catch to mid-on. In the second innings he showed more composure under pressure, as he batted through a collapse to finish with 39 not out.

I was honoured to represent my country and to step into the Test arena is something I dreamt about since I started playing,” he said. “My dad came down the night before the game once I was told I was playing. We’ve been through thick and thin together since I was a little boy. He was over the moon and probably even more excited than me. “And I was probably a bit too excited and played a few too many shots! I was a bit too expansive and gave my wicket away. In the second innings, I was a lot more composed and controlled, back to my normal self. “I’m not sure if it was brave or stupid the way I got off the mark, but when you’re that excited it’s tough to fight it and you just have to let it happen and try and make the best decisions,” Rickelton said.
