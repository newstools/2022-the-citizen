TURFFONTEIN INSIDE  BEST BET RACE 9 NO 9 NAVAL GUARD – WIN Paul Peter’s charge has improved markedly since having been gelded and could not have been more impressive when winning last time. He is strongly expected to follow up this time. According to his trainer there could be a feature race win in his near future. VALUE BET RACE 6 NO 6 GLOBAL RANSOM – EACHWAY This is another Paul Peter runner with Warren Kennedy up but while his form has not been that good of late, his merit rating has come down significantly and that could help him as he will be running against weaker opposition. Global Ransom is nicely drawn at No 2 which will help his chances.
