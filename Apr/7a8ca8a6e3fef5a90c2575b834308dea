Homely Girl is a Freedom Day gift for punters in Race 7 at Turffontein on Wednesday, when racing is on the Inside track. The three-year-old filly recently transferred to Johan Janse van Vuuren’s stables in Joburg from Cape Town, where she was never out of the money in eight starts while notching two wins and assembling a merit rating of 105. Her rating makes her the best-weighted horse by some margin in the Graduation Plate over 1450m. Her 57kg means she carries less or about the same as other two-time winners in the contest, but they haven’t mixed in anything like the top company she has. Homely Girl won a feature race at Fairview when raiding up the coast for Justin Snaith and was later a brilliant third in the Grade 1 Cape Fillies Guineas, behind Chansonette. Her Highveld debut came at Turffontein a month ago, after a four-month break, and she managed a good second behind useful Tuscan Winter over 1160m. The step up to 1450m is ideal for the daughter of Querari, while the No 5 starting stall could hardly be improved upon. Homely Girl is an obvious banker in all bets.
