BEST BET RACE 4 NO 5 LINE OF DUTY – WIN Brett Crawford is raiding from the Western Cape and his form looks a lot better than his opposition. He finished just 2.35 lengths behind Thunder Master who will be running in a Grade 3 race at Kenilworth on Sunday. VALUE BET RACE 6 NO 11 JACK AND GINGER – EACHWAY Jack And Ginger joined Gavin Smith’s yard from Cape Town in February and made a winning start last time. It was just a Maiden Plate but the four-year-old gelding won well and could follow up in a weak field. He is 10-1 but has JP van der Merwe up and he is in top form.
