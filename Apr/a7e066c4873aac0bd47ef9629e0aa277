BEST BET RACE 2 NO 4 BLUE WATERS – WIN This is a first-timer trained by Paul Peter and the word from the stable is that he is pretty decent. There is not much opposition, and if he is half good, he should win. He has a top jockey up in Warren Kennedy. VALUE BET RACE 10 NO 5 GRECIA – EACHWAY This Brett Webber-trained filly has run only four times for a win and a second, but last time (although finishing ninth) she was only beaten 2.50 length after a slow start, producing a strong finish. That race was over 1000m so she will enjoy the extra 160m this time. Calvin Habib was the jockey up when she won her maiden and ran second, and he is back in the irons again.
