Because we are dominating but we are not playing with that oomph that we need to play with. But as soon as we made changes (things worked out). I’m grateful to Monde, because he put up a good shift create the goal we scored and Junior did well by getting inside the box. “Sometimes you get these things, particularly in knockout matches where there is a lot of tension and the players are worried about the next stage instead of what is happening now,” said the Gallants coach, who won the Nedbank Cup back in 2019 with TS Galaxy, while the club was still playing in the GladAfrica Championship. “But, having said that, we are very grateful to have won the match. We are very grateful to have gotten to the next round. All praise must go to the boys. Yes, with all our mistakes, but everyone makes mistakes, the opponents made mistakes. We are just grateful to go to the next round.”
