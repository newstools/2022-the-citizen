You’re forgiven for being a tad gun-shy of Fairview racecourse after the results of last Friday, when a series of whoppers mercilessly mowed down the punters. But let’s look forward and try to build confidence by telling ourselves those 66-1 and 25-1 rounds came from a machine-gun nest on the turf track whereas this Friday the action is on the Polytrack, which is often a lot more forgiving to man and beast. Still, the human inclination is to search for hidden explosive devices lurking in the Fairview form – especially as many in-form runners on this card have very wide draws. By definition, finding roughies is hard, but close scrutiny – not to mention blindfold-and-stab in the dark – can throw up a few “lurkers”.
