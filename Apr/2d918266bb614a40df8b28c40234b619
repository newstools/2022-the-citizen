Bangladesh collapsed again like a tyre on a potholed South African road as Keshav Maharaj ended with another seven-wicket haul and the Proteas won the second Test by a massive 332 runs at St George’s Park on Monday. As impressive as South Africa were in wrapping up a 2-0 series win by bowling Bangladesh out for just 80, needing just 59 minutes on Monday to take the last seven wickets, it was a deflating end to the tour for the visitors, who had begun with such promise by winning the ODI series. But they showed no stomach for the fight on Monday. Resuming on 27/3, they lost three wickets in the first 4.5 overs as Mushfiqur Rahim (1) fell to a superb catch by Dean Elgar at slip and Mominul Haque (5) and Yasir Ali (0) were both caught off attempted slog-sweeps. Liton Das (27) and Mehidy Hasan Miraz (20) enjoyed hitting a few boundaries, but Maharaj kept wheeling away from the Duckpond End and dismantling the Bangladesh batting.  The left-arm spinner became the first man in Test history to take seven wickets in the fourth innings of consecutive Tests. His final figures on Monday were an exceptional 7/40 in 12 overs, the best ever figures by a South African at St George’s Park, improving on Allan Donald’s 7/84 against India in 1992/93. With Simon Harmer chipping in with 3/34 in 11.3 overs, the wheels fell off Bangladesh’s batting in just 23.3 overs. It was another dismal effort following their awful 53 all out in the first Test in Durban.
