There are just two changes to the Stormers starting line-up for their United Rugby Championship encounter with Glasgow Warriors at Cape Town Stadium on Friday. The Stormers will be looking to make it seven consecutive home wins when they host the Scottish outfit at 6.30pm on Friday. Both changes to the starting team come in the forward pack, with Frans Malherbe at tighthead prop and Junior Pokomela on the flank in place of Deon Fourie, who has not yet completely recovered from a minor leg injury. Lock Salmaan Moerat and fullback Warrick Gelant will both make their return from injury from the bench, with front row forwards Ali Vermaak and JJ Kotze also among the replacements. Stormers coach John Dobson said that his team are looking forward to playing in front of their home fans again. “Our last match was a special occasion with an incredible atmosphere, so we are all really looking forward to getting back into it after a short break. “It is fantastic to welcome back the likes of Salmaan and Warrick, while also keeping some continuity in the team. “We know that we are in for another real test, so the focus is on taking another step-up on Friday,” he said. Stormers: Damian Willemse, Seabelo Senatla, Ruhan Nel, Rikus Pretorius, Leolin Zas, Manie Libbok, Herschel Jantjies, Evan Roos, Hacjivah Dayimani, Junior Pokomela, Marvin Orie, Adre Smith, Frans Malherbe, Scarra Ntubeni, Steven Kitshoff (capt).
