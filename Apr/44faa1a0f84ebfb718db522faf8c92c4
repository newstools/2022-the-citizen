Another big donor is France, which will provide 166 million euros in food support this year.

Acute food insecurity in the region has almost quadrupled since 2019, affecting more than 40 million today compared to 10.8 million three years ago, according to the FAO. Extreme drought, the Covid-19 pandemic and now the war in Ukraine, which is pushing up world grain prices, are amplifying factors. The pledges were made at a high-level meeting on Wednesday organised by the so-called Sahel and West Africa Club, the EU and the Global Network Against Food Crises. The meeting looked at immediate problems of food aid as well as structural hurdles affecting the region’s food supplies.
