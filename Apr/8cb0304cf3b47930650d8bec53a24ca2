The Naturena-side also have another case that is still pending with the PSL of failing to honour two of their fixtures in the same month. PSL prosecutor Zola Majavu has given an update on the cases and also revealed that Cape Town City boss John Comitis will also appear before the DC on Friday. “Kaizer Chiefs appeared before the DC earlier today to answer to charges of fielding two ineligible players who were originally registered for the Diski Challenge. They were however used in a fixture between Chiefs and Sekhukhune.  “The case has been postponed to May 13 for final arguments and on that day in the direction of the panel the matter must be finalised. What would then be outstanding would be a judgement that would be reserved, mindful that the season is drawing to an end,” said Majavu in an audio clip released by the PSL on Tuesday morning. “I can also confirm that the review case arising from the arbitrator’s award in the Kaizer Chiefs case has been enrolled for hearing by the Johannesburg High Court on May 10. Again once a court decision has been made, in that regard I will notify accordingly and to the effect that it may have a bearing on the DC that is currently put on hold pertaining to the two fixtures that Kaizer Chiefs did not honour. Those cases are still pending on the PSL DC depending on the outcome of the review case.  “The second confirmation is that Mr John Commitis will appear before the DC on Friday to answer to charges of bringing the league into disrepute based on some media utterances attributable to him which is subsequently as having been true and accurate. Once these matters are finalised, I will then give an update on the decisions.”
