The 2022 Work Riders’ Challenge is set to be a straight shootout between current log leader Phenisile Mongqawa and former champ Sam Mosia when the third and final leg of the series is contested at the Vaal on Thursday. On 72 points and 66 points respectively, the two are well clear of third-placed Anathi Feni (32), who needs to win on all three of his rides on the day to have any chance of overhauling them. Interestingly, though, Feni does have a strong hand and could conceivably notch a couple of victories. Last year’s Challenge champion Joe Gwingwizha lies fourth on the log after the first two legs, with Tshepiso Matsoele in fifth. They would need a miracle to win the big prize but could pick up place cheques. The overall winner pockets R20,000, the runner-up R10,000 and third R5,000. The winner on the day gets R5,000. Ten points are awarded for a win, seven for second, five for third and three for fourth. Mongqawa has five rides at the eight-race meeting, with Paul Peter’s runners La Banquiere in Race 2 and Gimme A Dream in Race 6 probably offering his best chances. Sean Tarry’s Mon Tresor in the third will also be in punters’ calculations. Mosia’s hopes also mainly lie with the Peter stable, with Lady Osier in Race 3 and Double Magic in Race 7 likely to be bold challengers. Feni partners nicely bred debutant Victory Of Dubai for Mike de Kock in the first race; another for the same stable, Vaguely Familiar, in the fifth, and closes his book with Brett Crawford’s Chasing Mavericks in the sixth.
