Unconfirmed reports regarding alleged matrimonial drama between media personality Pabi Moloi and her ex Ruan Adams captured the public’s imagination on Sunday after making front-page tabloid news.  The rumours spread like wildfire on social media and the report was picked up by gossip blogger  Musa Khawula who shared a picture of Pabi Moloi standing next to a man who Musa linked to the story.However, the man in the photo is not the actual Ruan Adams in question. According to a report by Sunday World, Adams is demanding half of what he calls their shared multi-mullion Rand estate in his capacity as Pabi Moloi’s estranged husband.The publication cited a legal letter served to Moloi by Adams’ legal representation to communicate his desire to dissolve their marriage and split their assets accordingly.  In the legal letter, Adams insists they got married on 30 April 2016 after he paid lobola of R25,000. He claims that he has pictures to prove it and that all the necessary customs were observed.Under customary law, which views such marriages as community-of-property unions, he would then be entitled to half of their shared assets.  Listed among these assets are six properties, two cars, household furniture and Pabi Moloi’s shares, investments and savings.He also reportedly wants a monthly stipend for spousal support as Pabi had introduced him to a lifestyle that he now needs to maintain. Adams and Moloi share a child who is about five years old now.The publication cites a response from Moloi’s lawyers that states that she denies ever being married to Adams in any form, a claim that she repeated when contacted for comment.Due to the fact that men rarely make such demands in the event of a divorce and that cases in which this happens often go under the radar, public opinion was divided regarding Adams’ alleged demands.  Others judged him for making such requests while there were those who thought it was only fair.Some zoned in on the fact that he is white as most men belonging to that racial group are believed to be financially well-off.Many corrected Musa Khawula by alerting him to the fact that he had posted the wrong man but he did not retract or post an apology.
