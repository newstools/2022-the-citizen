Comedian, presenter, MC and facilitator Donovan Goliath has been announced as the host for the much-anticipated Real Housewives of Durban (RHODurban reunion) and viewers are not happy.When it comes to reality show reunions, the host is supposed to be someone that has a sense of credibility with viewers when it comes to the subject matter and Donovan sadly does not give off that vibe.  This also comes across in the names RHODurban viewers had thrown out there for their preferred hosts, names like Lasizwe Dambuza.  Reality television is deeply rooted in pop culture and the worlds of gossip, “spice,” “tea,” fashion and beauty and these aren’t things one would associate with Donovan or consider him to be a fan of.The two-part RHODurban reunion is set to air on 6 May 2022, a full two weeks after the final episode aired, much to the disappointment of viewers.  The second part of the reunion will air the following week on 13 May.   “I’ve always been intrigued by this concept and this show,” said Comics Choice nominee Donovan Goliath “I was excited to host the reunion because I really wanted to meet the wives and get to know more about this world from them,” he added in a statement.Explaining the decision to choose Donovan as the host, Let It Rain Films executive producer Sam Kelly said, “Donovan was the perfect host because he came with the right amount of humour, the right amount of compassion, and the right amount of love for all of the ladies and the storylines on The Real Housewives of Durban.”  But humour, compassion and love are not what viewers seemed to want from their host.  “Some divides are going to be cemented and some bridges are going to be built, so it’s a great reunion,” added Kelly regarding what viewers can expect for the RHODurban reunion.  Another major part of reality show reunions that viewers often look forward to is the cast mates’ outfits and it’s safe to say we all cannot wait to see what stars Annie, Jojo, LaConco, Londie, Mabusi, MaKhumalo, Nonku, and Sorisha choose to wear for the RHODurban season 2 reunion.  “After Nonku’s mother, The Queen, faced off with Ayanda Ncwane in the controversial Season 1 reunion over damages, the Season 2 reunion has a lot to live up to – but there’s no shortage of tensions that need to be resolved from Season 2, especially after Indaba Ka Petal about LaConco’s mystery man, Jojo throwing her drink at Mabusi, and MaKhumalo being called out for distancing herself from the group.”
