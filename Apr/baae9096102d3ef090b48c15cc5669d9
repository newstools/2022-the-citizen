We are confident that we will have to give it our best shot and compete on the day.” Dynamos beat GladAfrica Championship side Uthongathi FC in the last 32 and went past fellow second division side Black Eagles in the last 16. Sundowns on the other side, annihilated Richards Bay and Mathaithai FC, beating them 4-0 and 6-0 respectively, to reach the last eight. Mngqithi, however, believes that in Clinton Larsen, Dynamos have a very capable coach who has had a couple of upsets when it comes to Sundowns. “If you remember when he was at Bloemfontein Celtic in the Telkom Knockout Cup, remember the MTN 8 at Lucas Moripe and we are very aware that we are coming up against a very experienced coach and we need to tread very careful,” concluded Mngqithi.Kick off for this ‘Goliath versus David’ clash is 6pm.Meanwhile, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila edged SuperSport United 3-2 after extra-time to become the first side to reach the semifinals.
