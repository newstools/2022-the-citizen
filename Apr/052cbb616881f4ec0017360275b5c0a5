Sharks head coach Sean Everitt has had the good fortune of retaining pretty much the same side that thumped the Dragons last weekend, with a couple of rotational changes thrown in to keep everyone fresh and hungry, as they prepare for their United Rugby Championship match against the Lions in Durban on Saturday. Reniel Hugo returns to the starting line-up with Le Roux Roets shifting to the bench while Springbok captain Siya Kolisi also gets a start for James Venter, who led the Currie Cup side to victory over Griquas on Wednesday evening. The final change to the pack sees Henco Venter coming in for Jeandre Labushagne who will feature off the bench later in the game.

The South African sides all have a game in hand over the top five teams on the log, so a win for the Sharks this weekend will give their campaign a major boost. “The log is really important at the moment and a win this week will be big for us because the other two local franchises are also playing each other and we’re fighting in the SA Shield competition.” Sharks team Ox Nche, Bongi Mbonambi, Thomas du Toit (captain), Gerbrandt Grobler, Reniel Hugo, Siya Kolisi, Henco Venter, Phepsi Buthelezi, Jaden Hendrikse, Curwin Bosch, Makazole Mapimpi, Marius Louw, Ben Tapuai, Werner Kok, Anthony Volmink Bench: Kerron van Vuuren, Ntuthuko Mchunu, Khutha Mchunu, Le Roux Roets, Jeandre Labuschagne, Sikhumbuzo Notshe, Grant Williams, Boeta Chamberlain
