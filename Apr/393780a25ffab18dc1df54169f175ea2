Punters said Ed happily joined in a game of pool as he mingled with the crowds and enjoyed a pint with rapper pal Jaykae. Mobile phone footage shows the Shape Of You star clutching a beer and enjoying a singalong around the pool table to No Games by Serani. He can also be seen pulling pints behind the bar wearing a North Face jacket and joking with the manager: “You’re paying me.” Pub manager Ian Connors, 39, a dad-of-two from Small Heath, who runs the bar, which is a favourite haunt for Birmingham City FC fans, said: “It was a bit crazy. “He is good pals with the Birmingham rapper Jaykae who sometimes comes in here and he called me up and said can I bring someone along. “We were having a pool tournament last night and we had a DJ on so it was pretty busy and I said of course bring whoever you like. “All of a sudden, this guy walks in and everybody starts going ‘Is that Ed Sheeran?’ We were thinking ‘surely not’. “We couldn’t understand what a megastar like him would be doing in a pub in Small Heath. “But he was brilliant, really laid back and he mingled with customers. He was just a gentleman. Really down-to-earth and was having a good laugh.”
