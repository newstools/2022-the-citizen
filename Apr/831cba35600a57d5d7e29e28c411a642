All teams are there because of something. There are tough opponents (in the quarter-finals),” said the Simba coach via Simba TV. “What I am sure of is that they are also very worried about the draw. They are not happy because they have to face us, such a good team. We will try to play good football, but at this stage, there is no margin for mistakes. We need to continue with the same performance.” Simba made it to this stage of the competition after finishing as runners-up in Group D, with the club accumulating 10 points having won three games, lost two and drew one in the six group matches. They will be coming up against a Pirates’ side that only lost one match, drew one and won four of the games which placed them at the top of Group B standings with 13 points. With the first game being played in Tanzania, the Buccaneers will have to prepare very well for that encounter. Simba won all of their group stage games at home. The first leg will be played on 17 April, with the return leg scheduled for 24 April.
