Late Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini’s sister princess Thembi Zulu-Ndlovu has passed on. This was confirmed by her brother prince Mbonisi Zulu on Friday evening.  He told Newzroom Afrika that she was taken to a hospital in Newcastle on Friday morning and died in the afternoon.  Zulu told the news channel Zulu-Ndlovu and the late king had a close relationship as they grew up together.  “When the king revived the reed dance, she was at the forefront. She was close to the king, so when you talk about them, you talk about people who grew up in the royal family together. When you lose someone very close to you, now I’m the elder, you ask, who is next?” ALSO READ: ‘Anything is possible,’ says Zulu king on getting more wives The prince said it was his sister’s wish for the family to unite.  “She has always saying we as the family would love to meet our brother’s children.
