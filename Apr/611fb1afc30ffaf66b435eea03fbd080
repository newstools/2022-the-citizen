The Bulls are currently in possession of all the senior rugby trophies on offer in South Africa. In what the Pretoria-based union believe to be a first in the country, and possibly the world, the Bulls have in their cabinet the following trophies and cups for five competitions: the Currie Cup, the Super Rugby Unlocked, the U-19, U-20 and U-21. Union president Willem Strauss said the Bulls region also had the SA Rainbow Cup and Varsity Cup, thanks to Tuks (University of Pretoria) winning the competition last year. Tuks will play in the Varsity Cup final again on Monday, against old foes Maties, while the Bulls senior side is still in contention in the new United Rugby Championship, which is nearing its conclusion, while they are also still chasing another Currie Cup crown. “Every single trophy of every professional rugby competition in SA currently resides at Loftus!” tweeted Strauss. “Add the Varsity Cup of Tuks and it’s not just unequalled in the history of SA rugby, but a rare feat in professional sport anywhere.” Sharks CEO Eduard Coetzee was one of the first to congratulate Strauss and the Bulls on their achievement. “Well done gents, a great achievement!” Coetzee tweeted.
