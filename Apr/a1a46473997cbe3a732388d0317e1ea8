Orlando Pirates have been found guilty of bringing the league into disrepute, after they refused to allow TS Galaxy owner Tim Sukazi entry to Orlando Stadium for their DStv Premiership clash on December 11.

After that the DC will make a final decision.” A video emerged ahead of the December 11 game of Pirates security manhandling Sukazi outside Orlando Stadium. It is unclear what punishment the league will now hand out to Pirates, but Sukazi told the Daily Sun in February that he would be happy if Pirates issued a public apology to TS Galaxy and the supporters.  “If Pirates are found guilty, they should lead by example, show leadership, and own up to their conduct. They must issue a public apology to the fans and TS Galaxy,” said Sukazi.
