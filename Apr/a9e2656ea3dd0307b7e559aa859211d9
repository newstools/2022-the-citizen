Mike de Kock has spoken about the quality of British-bred filly Good Queen Bess, who survived a post-race colic scare in October 2021 and bravely returned to racing about five months later. On Thursday, the daughter of Kingman steps out again at the Vaal, in Race 7, and can be expected to confirm the master trainer’s high regard with a second career victory. Imported by Wilgerbosdrift stud with breeding potential in mind, Good Queen Bess won impressively on debut at Turffontein in April last year. Something was amiss when she disappointed in her next assignment, but she almost made amends in her third effort, finishing runner up – but was then immediately struck down by the agony of colic. It would have been easy and understandable for the connections to pack the filly off to the farm paddocks, but presumably her galloping ability gave them pause and they nursed her back to racing health. Good Queen Bess’s comeback run was a commendable third – after a fly-jump at the start and having to switch course in the run-in. Richard Fourie was the rider that day and will have learnt a bit about the filly. With a nice galloping weight of 54.5kg in the FM92 Handicap, we look forward to a big run.
