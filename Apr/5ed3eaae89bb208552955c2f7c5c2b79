With four games to the finish line, the Natal Rich Boys’ campaign went belly-up last season. They were overtaken to the finish line by both Royal AM and Sekhukhune United.

AmaTuks are now in first position with a two points lead over the Rich Boys. There are however still five games for Bay to try and get their place back. But they will have to really up their game with the three teams behind them also probably fancying their chances. JDR Stars and Cape Town All Stars are both three points behind Bay, and Venda Football Academy is also in with a shout four points behind. In their last five games, Bay have Platinum City Rovers away, Hungry Lions at home, Uthongathi at home, TS Sporting away, and finish the campaign at home against Cape Town Spurs.
