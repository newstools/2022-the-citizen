President Cyril Ramaphosa is addressing a hybrid joint sitting of Parliament this afternoon on the devastation caused by the disastrous flooding in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). The joint sitting, which comprises the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), was called by Ramaphosa last week in terms of Section 84(2)(d) of the Constitution.

The proceedings at the Cape of Good Hope Chambers were scheduled to begin at 2pm in Cape Town. Ramaphosa said he wanted MPs, as South Africa’s elected representatives, to be directly involved in oversight of the work that is needed to provide relief and rebuild KZN. “Government’s response is unfolding in three phases: firstly, immediate humanitarian relief, ensuring that all affected persons are safe and that their basic needs are met. “Secondly, building shelters for people who have lost their homes and restoring provision of services.” “Thirdly, on reconstruction and rebuilding of infrastructure,” acting Presidency spokesperson Tyrone Seale said in a statement.
