Stormers No 8 Evan Roos has won another United Rugby Championship award – fans’ player of the season. Roos was last week named Next-Gen player of the season — awarded to a player under 23 and with no more than five Test caps – while he was also included in the Dream Team. The latest award is voted for by the public. The 22-year-old, who was also included in the Springbok squad on Saturday for the three-Test series against Wales next month, scored a try in the URC semifinal against Ulster at the weekend. Roos has become a key member of the Stormers squad this season, making 126 successful carries, while beating 49 defenders – more than any other player in the competition. Stormers teammate Leolin Zas has also won an individual award this season, that of top try-scorer. He was also named in the Dream Team. The URC has dished out several awards in the last two weeks, with just two remaining: Coach of the season and Players’ player of the season. They will be announced later this week.
