Davids, who joined the organisation in 2019 as an Assistant Coach, will leave the Club upon the expiration of his contract at the end of this month,” said the club on their website. “Ever professional and always disciplined in his approach, Mr Davids leaves the Club having performed his duties in an exemplary manner.” Pirates also confirmed the departure of their head performance analyst Darian Wilken, who is said to be venturing on coaching. “Meanwhile, the Club can also confirm the departure of Head Performance Analyst Darian Wilken. Mr Wilken has expressed his intention to head into coaching which is a decision the club respects and supports. There is no doubt that he will be an asset to the South African football industry one day.” “On behalf of the Club, we would like to wish both Mr Davids and Mr Wilken all the best in their future endeavours.”
