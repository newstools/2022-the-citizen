I have been reviewing the Philips All-In-One Cooker for about a week now and the thing I love most about the appliance is that you just put all your ingredients in the pot, close the lid and set the timer. It really is one of the most convenient ways to prepare a healthy, nutritious and very flavourful meal for your family. This recipe was originally shared by Low Carb Nikki in 2019. I discovered it during my Google search for the perfect Sunday lunch recipe and decided to test it in the All-In-One Cooker. The results blew my husband’s taste buds. He now calls me a culinary goddess. ALSO SEE: Recipe of the day: Pull apart cheeseburger sliders I used the lamb pressure cooker setting for this dish and set the timer to 59 minutes. When the time elapsed, I opened the lid and set the timer for another 59 minutes as the meat was not yet soft enough to shred with a fork.
