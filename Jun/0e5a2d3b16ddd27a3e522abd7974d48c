It has not even been a week since Fadlu Davids was told by Orlando Pirates that he would not be retained when his current contract ends at the end of June, but it looks like he already has a new job.  Davids was seen sitting with his mentor Ernst Middendorp as they watched the promotional playoffs match between University of Pretoria and Swallows FC at the weekend.

The 28-year-old midfielder is highly rated and some have said he has similar qualities to Bongani Zungu.  According to a report on the SABC Sport website, Ngoma is also willing to relocate to South Africa.  “The only problem is that the position he plays is overloaded at Chiefs at the moment. He is quality and is being considered but they might just not take him,” a source at the club has told Phakaaathi.
