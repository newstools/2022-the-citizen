At this stage, 3,307 megawatts (MW) is on planned maintenance, while another 15,844MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. “Eskom cautions the public that as the shortage of generation capacity persists, the system will continue to be constrained with an elevated risk of load shedding over the coming weeks. We would like to remind the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid,” Eskom further said.
