Johannesburg Water has announced that some of its reservoirs and sewer network points will be isolated on Tuesday night as the search for missing Khayalethu Magadla continues. Johannesburg Water officials and the authorities from the SAPS and EMS will continue with the search for Khayalethu, a 6-year-old boy who allegedly fell into a sewer manhole while playing with his friends at Dlamini park, Soweto on Sunday, 12 June 2022. The search at the localised manhole entry point has not yielded any results, said Johannesburg Water in a statement on Tuesday.  The manhole has been secured. “The technologies used to assist with a more detailed search in the previous week did not provide results, and therefore the entity will be isolating specific reservoirs and direct feeds, as well as plugging localised sewer lines in order to reduce the flow into the larger sewer network. This will allow for the search and rescue team to inspect the sewer line,” said Johannesburg Water.

The plugging of specific sewer points to reduce flow will result in blockages and as a result, residents in Lenasia, Lehae, Protea South, Chiawelo and Midway Industrial will notice an increase in sewer blockages. “Johannesburg Water pleads with the community for support, understanding and patience as the team focuses on the search and recovery of the body of the missing boy,” said the entity.
