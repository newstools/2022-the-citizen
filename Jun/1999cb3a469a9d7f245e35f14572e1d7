TURFFONTEIN BEST BET RACE 2 NO 1 MERCANTOUR – WIN This is the only two-time winner in the field. Last time he ran in a feature over 1400m but failed to stay on, so back to 1200m he will be very hard to beat. VALUE BET RACE 6 NO 2 CASTLE DURROW – EACHWAY She was a decent three-year-old who seemed to lose her way, but her merit rating is coming down and she is now racing against weaker. She is due a win so at 8-1 she looks a decent enough value bet.
