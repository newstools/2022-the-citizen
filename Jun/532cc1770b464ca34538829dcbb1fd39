Gardee – the daughter of former EFF secretary-general and attorney, Godrich Gardee – was abducted on 29 April and her body was found along Lydenburg Road in the Sabie area outside Mbombela. She was 28 years old. During the suspect’s last court appearance last month, Lukhele and Gama abandoned their bail application, and the matter was postponed to 9 June for further investigation. Last Friday, Mkhatshwa was in court for his bail hearing, however, his lawyers withdrew from representing him during proceedings for his bail application.  Mkhatshwa’s legal representatives told Magistrate Eddie Hall they could not represent him because of a conflict of interest that was not disclosed in court.  The Gardee family and the leadership of the EFF were expected to be present in court on Thursday when the suspects appear.
