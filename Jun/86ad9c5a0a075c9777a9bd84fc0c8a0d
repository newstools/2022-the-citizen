For the first time since 2019, there is expected to be a full house at Greyville on Saturday for the running of this year’s R5-million Hollywoodbets Durban July.  With the lifting of all Covid restrictions and the news that all sporting and other events have opened up unconditionally, Greyville Racecourse is looking forward to welcoming thousands of horse racing fans. “The fact that proof of vaccination or negative PCR tests is no longer a requirement for entry to the racecourse is most welcome and a great boost for the event,” said marketing and events executive Stephen Marshall.
