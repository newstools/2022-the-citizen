South African rugby’s director of rugby Rassie Erasmus is back on Twitter and ready to entertain his fans with insight, wisdom and comment ahead of the Springboks’ international season. This, after Erasmus’ Twitter account was allegedly hacked over the weekend, and a pornographic video clip retweeted by his handle. Erasmus moved swiftly on Saturday morning to apologise to his followers for the hack. “Sorry guys about the inappropriate tweets!! The handle has been hacked!!”  Later on Saturday, hours after the inappropriate tweet had been sent out, Erasmus said: “Guys and ladies thanks for the advice to undo the retweet!! It is deleted on my account, but I did not retweet it!! The moment I delete it pops up again somewhere else! Appreciate the concern.” Then, on Tuesday evening, Erasmus tweeted that his account had been sorted out. “Lekka,” he said. Erasmus and Springboks head coach Jacques Nienaber are currently in a training camp with 17 selected players ahead of the three-Test series with Wales next month.  More players are expected to join the group from next week once their teams complete their commitments in the URC and English and French rugby competitions. This is a modal window.
