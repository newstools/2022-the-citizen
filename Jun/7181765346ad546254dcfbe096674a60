And went to Cloorkop to be benched while Chiefs were on the verge of winning the league!” Uyihlo @Mtho_ Chipped in with: “George Maluleka was basically a pawn eliminated by Pitso to destabilise Chiefs in that painful season. The mistake Chiefs Management made was to freeze him out for remainder of that season had he been allowed to play Chiefs would’ve won the league he contributed a lot of assists.” @Mabua_ wrote: “I won’t pretend that I’m sad that things didn’t work out for George Maluleka at Sundowns. He made his choice and he must live with it. I hope he finds a team because yena he is talented.” There were however a few who sympathised with Maluleka saying his move was good because he got to win four trophies in two seasons.  Gooseberry @RhuNdimande: “So, George Maluleka got a bumper contract/pension fund contract at Sundowns, won four major trophies and is now free to join a club of his own. I’d say that’s not been a bad move” The news of his release were announced by Far Post on Wednesday evening and has since spread like wildfire on social media.
