South African lightweight boxer Simiso Buthelezi has died. Buthelezi, who seemed to lose consciousness during a World Boxing Federation Africa lightweight title fight in Durban on Sunday, passed away on Tuesday night.  He had been in an induced coma after losing his bearings in the 10th round in his fight with Siphesihle Mntungwa. Footage that did the rounds on social media on Sunday and Monday showed the boxer, seconds after knocking his opponent to the ground, punching at thin air and mistaking the referee for his opponent.  Seeing that Buthelezi was in no shape to continue the fight, the referee immediately ended the bout. At the time, Buthelezi’s trainer, Bheki Mngomezulu, confirmed the boxer was in a coma, adding: “He’s not talking, moving, or doing anything right now”. “The doctors say there could be a blood clot on the brain due to a blow to the head.” His training said he “didn’t see him taking serious blows during the fight”, and he suspected something similar was at play.
