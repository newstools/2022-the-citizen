The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has warned residents in the Richtersveld municipality in the Northern Cape of a heat wave with persistently high temperatures set to hit the area until Friday.  “When the temperature is extremely high, humans’ ability to cool their bodies through sweating is reduced. This can be a real threat that leads to hypothermia. If a heat wave occurs during a drought, which dries out vegetation, it can contribute to veld fires,” warned the weather service.
