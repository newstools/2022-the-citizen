Chapman’s Peak in the Western Cape has been closed after a rock fall between Noordhoek and Hout Bay in Cape Town.  The rock fall comes after a strong cold front made landfall in Cape Town on Sunday night, with the South African Weather Service (Saws) warning residents of icy conditions sweeping over the province for the rest of the week. The adverse weather conditions have brought intense strong winds and heavy downpours in most parts of the province. “These cold fronts are expected to result in strong winds, high waves, heavy rainfall, light snow and a significant drop in temperatures,” warned the weather service.
