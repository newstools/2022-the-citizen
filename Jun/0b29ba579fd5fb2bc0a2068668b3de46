Top Spanish fashion designers Victorio and Lucchino, who have dressed singers and aristocrats, on Thursday inaugurated a museum dedicated to their works in their southern home region of Andalusia. The museum housed in a centuries-old former convent in the southern city of Palma del Rio displays a retrospective of their creations, which are characterised by bright colours and the use of lace and ruffles. It includes fabrics, dress prototypes, shows, accesseries and jewellery from a career spanning nearly five decades.

Lucchino and Jose Victor Rodriguez Caro, 72, who goes by the alias Victorio, met as teenagers in the 1960s and soon became a couple, united by their passion for fashion. They joined forces in 1975 to create the Victorio y Lucchino brand, and burst onto the international scene a decade later by taking part in the New York International Fair. Their creations have since appeared on catwalks in Japan, Germany, Italy and the United States, worn by top models such as Claudia Schiffer and Elle McPherson.

She wore a salmon-coloured dress with a moss-green sash by the Andalusian designers at her 2011 wedding to a civil servant at her palace in Seville. The designers say they have long drawn inspiration from the culture of Andalusia, Spain’s centre for flamenco and bullfighting. “Every creator lives from the land where he lives,” said Victorio who was born in Palma del Rio.
