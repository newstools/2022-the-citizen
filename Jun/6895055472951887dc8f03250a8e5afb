President Cyril Ramaphosa has been informed of former spy boss Arthur Fraser’s criminal complaint against him and will respond to the allegations made in due course. This is according to Ramaphosa’s newly appointed spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya. Magwenya indicated the president was unable to respond to allegations made by Fraser because he was chairing a Cabinet meeting until late on Thursday. Fraser, the former director-general of the State Security Agency (SSA), on Wednesday laid a criminal complaint against Ramaphosa at the Rosebank police station. He accused the president of breaching the Prevention of Organised Crime Act by not reporting an alleged robbery at his Limpopo farm in 2020.

The suspects were allegedly kidnapped, interrogated, and paid off to keep silent about the alleged crime. Frazer alleged he had provided police with evidence showing how Ramaphosa “concealed the crime”, which allegedly took place on 9 February 2020. Frazer called on the president to tell South Africans the truth about what transpired at his farm. “I trust the police and the prosecuting authorities will investigate this matter without fear or favour, I also trust the president will take the nation into his confidence and accept or deny the events I describe in my affidavit occurred on his property,” he said in a statement widely circulated on social media.
