Actress Gugu Gumede is returning to South Africa’s most viewed television show Uzalo. The star made the announcement this week on her Instagram account after a long hiatus from television. “My 6-month maternity leave officially ends tomorrow. Excited to be back with my @uzalo_sabc1 fam, but incredibly nervous to leave my princess. Mommies, what made this transition easier for you? Please send some words of encouragement,” she wrote.  Fans heeded her call for words of encouragement, with The Real Housewives of Durban star Nonkanyiso ‘LaConco’ Conco sharing what helped her when she returned from her maternity leave.  “Prayer helped me, still does and will always. Don’t overthink it remember she is a precious gift from God. Enjoy your first day back at work mummy,” she commented. Gumede gave birth to her first child, a baby girl in February.
