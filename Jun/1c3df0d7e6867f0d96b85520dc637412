Springbok coach Jacques Nienaber says he is wary of next month’s opponents Wales despite their poor form in the Six Nations Championship this year, which included a home loss to lowly Italy. “It will be a tightly contested series. They know how we play and we have a pretty good idea of how they play,” he said on Wednesday ahead of the July 2, 9 and 16 Tests.

They will bring pride and be willing to take it to the gutter if they must. They can also open it up they want. “They always bring a physical edge to Tests, and their set-pieces are well coached,” Nienaber told reporters.
