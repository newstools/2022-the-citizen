The SA-born midfielder grew up in Australia before returning home to play for Chiefs in June 2019. He appeared in 53 matches with two goals in his three seasons,” wrote Chiefs on their social media platforms on Wednesday.The Glamour Boys also announced that defensive midfielder Agay Akumu has been placed on the transfer list. “The Club has put Kenyan defensive midfielder Anthony Akumu Agay on transfer. The Club will listen to offers from other Clubs for his services.

Chiefs caused a bit of a stir in April when they announced that they have appointed Aubrey Mathibe as the new goalkeeper coach even though they already had Baxter. “The Club and goalkeeper Coach Lee Baxter are going their separate ways. Lee arrived at Chiefs in February 2018 and worked with a number of Head Coaches and goalkeepers.”
