City of Johannesburg Emergency Management Services said they responded to the blaze in Orange Farm, Driezik extension 4. Spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi said the fire was caused by a lit candle which was left unattended. “The mother of the three children survived the incident unharmed as she is believed to have gone to the nearby shops to buy more candles as there was no electricity in the area when the fire happened,” said Mulaudzi. Mulaudzi said the cold weather conditions across the country had forced residents to warm themselves, in the process making themselves vulnerable to fire incidents. “We therefore would like to urge our residents, especially adults and parents, to make sure that all heating devices such as heaters, paraffin stoves, candles, imbaulas, are not left unattended or with young children while in use so that we can prevent fire incidents like this one,” Mulaudzi said.
