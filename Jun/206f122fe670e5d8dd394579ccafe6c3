Tanzania's Minister of Tourism and Natural Resources Pindi Chana has reinstated the ban on export of wildlife.The Minister issued the order following wide circulation of news that the government had reversed a decision made in 2016 to ban the export of wildlife."As the Minister in charge of this docket, I hereby issue an immediate order reinstating the ban of wildlife exports. The government has not received a formal application from the authority overseeing the matter, so until such a time when the application is lodged and a decision is made, the ban will continue to be effective," she said.Yesterday, a verified notice from the government had announced a temporary reversal of the wildlife exports ban, opening the door for business much to the dismay of many, with wildlife activists and other concerned bodies calling for a review of the decision.A day later, the government has backtracked on the wildlife exports green light.
