GREYVILLE POLYTRACK BEST BET RACE 4 NO 8 RUNNING RIFLES – WIN Justin Snaith and jockey Richard Fourie join forces in this race. The three-year-old gelding has been runner up in his last three races, all over 1400m, the distance of this race, all at Greyville, with two of those runs on the Polytrack. He is not all that well drawn at No 8 but that is less relevant on the Polytrack as they tend to go to the outside in the straight.    VALUE BET RACE 7 NO 2 CORNER CRUSADE – EACHWAY This three-year-old filly has a very good record over 1200m (the distance of this race) at this track with one win and three seconds from four runs. She is perfectly drawn at No 3, gets a 1.5kg apprentice allowance and looks sure to fight out the finish. She is trading at 7-1 in what is an open race.
