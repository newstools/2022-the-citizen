The newly-designed United Rugby Championship trophy arrived in South Africa this week and will be on display at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday when the Bulls host the Sharks in one of four quarterfinals matches this weekend. Named “The Array” the trophy stands 680mm tall and weighs almost 20kg. It is made of brass, copper and aluminium, and manufactured by Thomas Lyte, and designed by Matter.
