FAIRVIEW BEST BET RACE 7 SWINGER: 2-CHE VINCERA AND 5-HOLLY’S VIEW This is not an easy card but Justin Snaith looks to have a strong hand in this race with Che Vincera while the combination of Alan Greeff and jockey Greg Cheyne are always contenders in feature races. Both should be in the top three. VALUE BET RACE 8 NO 11 CHAMPAGNESOCIALIST – EACHWAY Sharon Kotzen has done well with this four-year-old Duke Of Marmalade gelding and the addition of blinkers saw him run second and then won well. That was on the Polytrack but if he repeats that form on the turf he could be quite dangerous in this race. At 16-1 he is definitely worth a bet.
