When starting off a new home paint project, be thoughtful of how you remove and discard of the old paint from your walls or furniture.  Old paint peelings are often washed into storm water drains, and this can cause harm and danger in the long run. Instead of discarding your peeled off paint, rather collect it into a container, and send it to a paint manufacturer who should be able to get rid of it in a much more responsible manner.  When you have completed your home DIY projects, look out for any materials which you can recycle instead of throw out.  If there are any home decor items or pieces of furniture which you no longer need and cannot sell, then you should consider donating them to your favourite charity, or any charity organisation in your hometown.  Donating your unwanted decor items and furniture keeps them out of landfills and makes sure the circular economy keeps moving.
