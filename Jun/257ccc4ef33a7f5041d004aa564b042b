We have a very important signing that we are making – you, the fan.  “You will be the 12th man on the field. You will be the most important signing that we are making for the season. As Cape Town Spurs we have dedicated this jersey number 12 which you can have with your own name and number 12 on the back.  “This gives you access to all our home games. As Cape Town Spurs we dedicate to all those who buy the jersey free entrance into our games. We know how important you are to us as a supporter.”  The Urban Warriors are expected to start revealing their new players that they have signed on Wednesday. But it is already known that they will have Boitumelo Radiopane on loan from Orlando Pirates.  Radiopane is seen as a perfect fit to replace Abednigo Mosiathlaga who has joined Sekhukhune United in the DStv Premiership.
