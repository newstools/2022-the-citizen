Annual consumer price inflation accelerated by 0,7% to 6,5% in May, from 5,9% in April and March, making it the highest reading since January 2017 when the rate was 6,6%.

This will definitely influence the next decision of the Sarb Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) when it meets again to determine the repo rate which will push up interest rates. According to Statistics SA, transport and food and non-alcoholic beverages accounted for just over half of the annual rate, with sharp price increases recorded in both categories.
