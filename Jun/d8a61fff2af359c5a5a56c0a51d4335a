Stormers rugby fans turned out in their thousands in Cape Town on Friday to celebrate their favourite team’s United Rugby Championship triumph over the Bulls last weekend. The victorious team beat the Bulls in a thrilling final played in front of a half full Cape Town Stadium last Saturday, 31,000 fans squeezed in due to then Covid restrictions on gatherings. Earlier this week, these restrictions were lifted by the government meaning stadiums in South Africa can now again fill up to capacity. On Friday though, there were no restrictions in Cape Town. There was singing and dancing in the streets and all the Stormers’ Springbok players, who’ve been in camp with the national team this week, joined in on the celebrations. Stormers loose forward Hacjivah Dayimani meanwhile quit his celebration spree on Thursday, saying he just couldn’t make it to seven days in his matchday kit. He said he needed to get ready for the pre-season and apologised to his fans, who hoped he’d go a full week partying it up in the city. Dayimani tweeted pictures of himself showering in his Stormers gear and sipping champagne, as well as pictures of himself at several Cape Town watering holes and eateries. He also enjoyed a “cold one” with the mayor of the city.
