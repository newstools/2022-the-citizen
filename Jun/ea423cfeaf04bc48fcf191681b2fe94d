Two minors have died after allegedly consuming contaminated food at a local dumping site. Police say investigations are underway. The two boys, aged five and nine, died after consuming an unknown substance while playing next to a dumping site. De Deur police in Sedibeng District were called to the scene of their deaths shortly after 11:30 on Wednesday, 15 June. According to police spokesperson Sergeant Thembeka Maxambela, the boys complained about being tired and hungry soon after returning from the dump site. Shortly thereafter, the boys complained of stomach aches. Maxambela was informed by eyewitnesses that the boys “both fell on the ground and white foam started flowing from their mouths”. “Both boys succumbed on the scene and were declared dead by EMS Services. It is not known what the boys consumed,” Maxambela told Sedibeng Ster. According to their sister, however, the duo said they picked up some bread which they ate, as they were hungry. Police say a search in the area where they were allegedly playing yielded no results.
