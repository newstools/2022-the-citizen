There are lots of logical reasons for buying a hybrid or electric car, but many people believe that these cars are too expensive. That is, however, is not the case. According to the latest data compiled by AutoTrader between January and April this year, which takes into account the cheapest used hybrid and electric vehicles, non-wholly internal combustion powered motivation is possible from less than R130 000.  “Motorists are hunting for information. The running costs of these cars are very low (versus cars with internal combustion engines). The escalating fuel price has made them more appealing than ever before. But buyers remain apprehensive about the purchase price,” AutoTrader CEO George Mienie said.
