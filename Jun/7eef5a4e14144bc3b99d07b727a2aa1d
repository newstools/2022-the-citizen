Municipal managers at some of South Africa’s financially ailing municipalities are laughing all the way to the bank, after Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma this week gazetted the determination of the upper limits of the salaries, allowances, wages and benefits for municipal councils. This was done after Dlamini-Zuma consulted with the Executive Council responsible for local government in each province. She explained the “salary and allowances of a councillor are determined by that municipal council, by resolution of a supporting vote of the majority of its members”. As per the gazette, a member of the executive committee or mayoral committee, a whip or a chairperson of a sub-council earns R1,100,361, while the chairperson of an oversight committee earns R1,068,083.  Personnel at grade five municipalities earn approximately 300K less (R1,078,407, R862,723, R808,804, and R785,080, respectively).  We can keep going down the list, but you get the idea. Consult the gazette below for the complete breakdown.  Keep in mind: a municipal manager’s basic salary excludes travel allowance, housing allowance, pension fund contributions, medical aid contributions, and performance bonuses.  Councillors who use private vehicles can claim back if they keep a travel logbook for dates travelled, kilometres travelled, and the reason for the trip.  Their cell phone allowance is capped at R3,400 per month inclusive of mobile data.  To determine municipal salaries and allowances, a point system based on a municipality’s income and the population under its jurisdiction is used. As per the Gazette (included below), an income above R2 trillion equals 50 points. Municipal income between R0 and R10,000,000 equals 8.33 points, whereas R10,000,001 to R50,000,000 equates to 16.67 points.  If a municipality has an income between R50,000,001 and R200,000,000, it would get 25 points; between R200,000,001 and R1,500,000,000 would be 33.33 points, between R1,500,000,001 and R2,000,000,000 would be 41.67.  The second factor is population, and the points are awarded as follows:  Finally, the municipality’s grade is brought into the equation. Utilising the same point system as the income and population factors, the grade allocation is as follows:  Based on this, an Executive Mayor or Mayor at a grade six municipality would earn a basic remuneration package of R1,446,338.  The speaker, deputy executive mayor, or deputy mayor would earn R1,168,131 a year.  For the sake of comparison, below is a breakdown of municipal manager salaries for 2019 and 2020. Even though the basic salary for a municipal manager has increased from R1.1 million during 2019/2022 to R1.4 million during 2021/2022, there are always salary outliers.  Once all the benefits are added to the mix, municipal managers easily earn more than R4 million, such as Dr Imogen Mashazi. Ekurhuleni is a category A grade 6 local authority, and Mashazi’s basic salary was R3,185,300 per annum, as per the municipality’s annual 2021 report.  Add to that R388,277 for pension, medical aid, and UIF, along with R194,528 as a car allowance, R364,631 as a performance bonus, and R55,200 ‘other’ payments, totalling R4,137,936 (page 80).  In 2016, Tshwane metro municipal manager Jason Ngobeni earned R3 million.  At the time, Ngobeni was the best paid civil servant in South Africa, earning more than former President Jacob Zuma (R2.8 million).  Ngobeni made headlines in 2018 when Tshwane had to clean up a botched deal in which Ngobeni approved a 99-year lease deal between the city and private company Tsoseletso Consortium.
