A dozen South Africans dressed as mermaids and mermen frolic in a Johannesburg pool, mimicking the movement of the mystical sea creatures. Mermaiding is a fast-growing sport worldwide, and now South Africa has its own school to teach it — the “Merschool”. Before diving in, students each slip on a brightly coloured fabric tail ending in a monofin. The swimmers are black and white, from 13 years old to in their forties. They include a schoolteacher, a yoga instructor and even an accountant. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

To be a mermaid — or merman — all that is required is a little technique, some breath-holding skills and a love of costumes. Underwater, students attempt to perform a graceful aquatic backflip. Nadia Walker, another mermaid coach from the world of synchronised swimming, says both sports have much in common. “The back rolls, some of the warm-ups and activities that we do, come from swimming,” she says. The school hopes to send at least one contender to next year’s World Mermaid Championships in China — and that one day the discipline will become an Olympic sport.
