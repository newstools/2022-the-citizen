BEST BET RACE 2 SWINGER: NO 6 IDEAL FUTURE AND NO 10 MORAINE This is not the strongest of races and Ideal Future is the runners with consistent form while Moraine is a first-timer from the Paul Peter yard who is said to be quite useful. They should fight out the finish. VALUE BET RACE 8 NO 1 ADMIRALTY ARCH – EACHWAY This three-year-old gelding has been running in Cape Town and will have his first run on the Highveld today for trainer Barend Botes. He has raced against stronger in Cape Town but what is interesting is the engagement of jockey S’manga Khumalo who rode him in Cape town last time. He is at 8-1 and could make a winning debut for his new stable.
