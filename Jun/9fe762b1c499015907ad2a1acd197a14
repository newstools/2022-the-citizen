Bulls director of rugby Jake White has picked his chosen men for the team’s United Rugby Championship semifinal against Leinster in Dublin on Friday night (kick-off 8.35pm). White has stuck largely with the same side that has done the business for him and the union of late, with quarterfinal hero Chris Smith retained at flyhalf. Veteran No 10 Morne Steyn will play off the bench.
