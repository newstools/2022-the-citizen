The National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) Investigating Directorate spokesperson Sindisiwe Seboka said the contracts were awarded between 2014 and 2017, for the procurement of toners, educational material, and digital recording systems. Seboka said the group faces charges of fraud, theft, corruption and forgery. “The group was arrested over the weekend and have been kept at the Silverton Police Station. Advocate Andrea Johnson says that the ID’s recent arrests linked to police contracts are a clear indication that no one, including any government department, will be exempt where there is proof of criminality. The consistent hard work of the joint ID/SAPS team is commended.” The matter returns to court on 29 June 2022 for allocation in the regional court.
