One of Gauteng’s most wanted criminals, linked to eight cases including the murder of a police officer, has been killed in a shootout. This comes after provincial police units conducted a takedown operation for the arrest of Mbuso Ndabazovela Biyela on Monday morning.  The police received intel after offering a reward on 29 May to anyone who had information on Biyela’s whereabouts. Police spokesperson Brigadier Brenda Muridili said the team had traced Biyela to Sahlumbe (Ematsheleni) village in Weenen in KwaZulu-Natal where he was hiding. But when Mbuso spotted the police, he opened fire on officers who retaliated. Biyela was killed in the shootout.  “Biyela was fatally wounded. None of the members sustained injuries. The team recovered an unlicensed firearm and ammunition upon entering the house,” Muridili said in a statement.
