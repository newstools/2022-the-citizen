South Africa’s return to the F1 calendar in 2023 has reportedly been signed off following a high-level meeting on Monday between management, stakeholders and Kyalami owner Toby Venter. In a series of tweets, motoring forum Motor Magnet alleges an apparent deal to bring Formula 1 back to South Africa for the first time since 1993 had been signed.  This was allegedly confirmed after a meeting with F1 CEO and President, Stefano Domenicali. The exact length of the deal though is unknown at present. Despite nothing having been made official, the forum claims the supposed agreement will pave the way for a series of upgrades to mainly the run-off areas in order to comply with Grade 1 FIA requirements the circuit currently doesn’t have.

While considerably less than the R5,000 previously alleged, it is again worth noting that nothing has been set in stone. Earlier today, the site published an image of a smiling Venter and Domenicali walking towards the main Kyalami hospitality area after an alleged inspection of the facility. Given the confirmation of the former Ferrari boss’ presence on local soil, expect an official announcement to be made sooner rather than later.
