South African rapper, businessman, and part-time boxer Refiloe ‘Cassper Nyovest’ Phoolo has recently been scammed out of an unknown amount of money, straight from his private bank account.  The Malome hitmaker took to social media to reveal that one of his bank cards had been cloned, and that the person who cloned it has been stealing money from his account for some time now. Cassper’s bank, First National Bank, responded to his tweet by asking if he had cancelled his cards and contacted the bank’s fraud department to get some assistance on the matter. The rapper reassured FNB that he did cancel the card and opened a case which is currently being investigated, and he also expressed how disappointed he is in the banking system.
