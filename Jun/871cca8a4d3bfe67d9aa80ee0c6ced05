The N3 highway at Van Reenen’s Pass and Tugela Plaza has been blocked off in both directions by truck drivers on Thursday. Motorists have been urged to avoid the area until the road is cleared.  It is believed that truck drivers are protesting against the employment of foreign nationals and the fuel hike.  Several articulated vehicles and trucks have been used to close both lanes of the N3 near Windy Corner, Van Reenen Pass.  According to KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker, truck drivers had parked the vehicles on the N3 and fled.  Traffic has since been diverted to alternative routes but traffic on the main route remains backed up in both directions.  “Police are on [the] scene and attempts are being made to tow those vehicles that are causing the blockage. The police will also be investigating this matter and are confident that the perpetrators will be traced and arrested at a later stage,” Naicker said.
