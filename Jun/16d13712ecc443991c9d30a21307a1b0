There has been an increase of 65 hospital admissions in the past 24 hours.  The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (Sahpra) has announced that anti-parasitic drug Ivermectin is no longer allowed to be prescribed to Covid-19 patients. Sahpra has terminated the controlled Compassionate Use Access Programme with immediate effect, saying there’s no credible evidence it helps treat Covid-19. It said there have been several developments regarding the evidence of efficacy of Ivermectin since the Programme was adopted. “No further importation of unregistered Ivermectin products will be allowed, and health facilities will no longer be enabled to hold bulk stock in anticipation of prescriptions for such unregistered Ivermectin products.” Sahpra also said the findings of two large clinical trials conducted in 2021 do not support the use of Ivermectin for patients with Covid-19.
