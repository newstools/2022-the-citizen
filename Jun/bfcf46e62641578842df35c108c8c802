If you still have no idea what gift to get for the men in your life this upcoming Father’s Day, you could gift them some alone time or bond with them while enjoying these sporting events this weekend.DStv suggests keeping dad indoors this coming weekend with events such as the US Open, the Diamond League and the T20 all airing during what the pay-tv platform calls “Big Sports Weekend”. “Put away the socks, make sure the fridge is stocked up and hand the remote over to dad: it’s his turn to take over because it’s all happening on SuperSport on 18 and 19 June, just in time for Father’s Day.” If you won’t be in front of the TV, all you need to do to keep a smile on dad’s face is download the MyDStv App and stream all the fixtures right as the whistle goes off.And best of all? You can take the financial weight off your shoulders in case your Father’s Day budget plans didn’t go your way.  Here is what you can look forward to.  Day 3 US Open main feed live from The Country Club, Massachusetts, USA on SuperSport Gold, DStv Channel 213 at 6pm.
