With recent focus having been on the all-electric EQG, Mercedes-Benz has unveiled the second iteration of the portal axle G-Class, albeit this time with an AMG flavour. Last offered four years ago on the previous generation of the still internally named W463 G-Class, the latest model no longer uses the G500 as a base, but rather the AMG G63 hence the change in moniker from G5002 to G632. Touted as being the final G-Class “squared” that will ever be produced, the inclusion of the axles, plus the off-road focused wheels encasing the 22-inch alloys, has resulted in a ground clearance of 351 mm, wading depth of 910 mm and approach angle of 45 degrees.

At the same, the spare wheel cover has been dropped in favour of a carbon wheel carrier still affixed to the door and a still bash plate equipped underneath the front bumper. Retained though is the side exhaust outlets and the Panamericana grille. Less extreme are the interior changes comprising Nappa leather seats, a Dinamica micro-fibre clad AMG steering wheel, carbon fibre inserts, a G63 4×42 logo on the grab handle and carried over from the standard G63, the dual 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and infotainment system. Underneath the bonnet, the 4.0-litre bi-turbo V8 retains its outputs of 430kW/850Nm, fed to all four corners as standard via the 9G Tronic transmission. As with all G-Wagens, the G632 boasts three locking differentials and a low range transfer case. Going on sale soon, no pricing figures were divulged, but reports from Germany suggest a starting sticker of between €250 000 (R4 148 740) to €300 000 (R4 978 489).
