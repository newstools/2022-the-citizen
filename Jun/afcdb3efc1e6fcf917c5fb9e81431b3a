The agreement means that developing countries can now produce their own vaccines without permission from the patent holders – at least for six months.

It will also allow for the use of certain information available in regulatory dossiers to fast-track generic manufacturing.     The agreement will cover Covid tests and treatment.     Although demand for Covid vaccines has dropped around the world, many developing countries still lag behind.     While 60 percent of the world’s population has received two vaccine doses, that number falls to 17 percent in Libya, eight percent in Nigeria and less than five percent in Cameroon, according to the World Health Organisation. “Our focus now is to ensure we address demand by persuading global procurers for vaccines to source from African producers,” the South African government said in a statement.
