Brekenkamp said residents in Letsitele town and the clinic also complained of foul-smelling water.  “I am worried about this because since April, when the municipality became aware of the contaminated water, no preventative measures have been taken or notices given to residents that the water may be unfit for consumption,” she said.  The Democratic Alliance (DA) has since registered a complaint with the Green Scorpions.
