A section of Orlando Pirates players are said to be trying to persuade the club’s management to bring Dan Malesela on board as part of the technical team alongside Mandla Ncikazi ahead of the 2022/23 DStv Premiership season.

I mean, just look at the team this past season, it wasn’t a good season because there was no trophy to present to the fans. But it doesn’t mean that the team is bad,” said the source. “There is something that is lacking and most of the guys seem to think he (Malesela) is one person who can fix that problem. Plus he knows the Pirates culture, he played at the club and another thing is that he knows most of the players in the team. I really don’t know what happened at Gallants, but they made a huge mistake by letting someone like him go, especially after taking the club to the final of the Nedbank Cup,” said the insider.
