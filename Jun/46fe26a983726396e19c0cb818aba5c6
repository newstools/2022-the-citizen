South African Football Association president Danny Jordaan admitted that he met with Bafana Bafana head coach Hugo Broos, after the Belgian criticised the quality of the local game at a press conference last week.

What is the real problem in South Africa? The real problem is that we don’t have those high-quality players,” said Broos at the time. “We don’t have those players like our three last opponents – Ghana, France, and Morocco.” Broos told the Safa congress: “I want to apologise if my declaration at the press conference was disrespectful against this nation,” said Broos. “It was not my intention, I came here a year ago and the only thing I want is that South African football becomes better. I think we are on the right path, but there is still a lot of work to do, and I hope the whole country will be with us, to change some things we have to change.” Broos had a good start to his career as Bafana coach, coming in and taking the side to the brink of reaching the play-offs for 2022 Fifa World Cup qualification. Bafana, however, lost their final group stage qualifier to Ghana to miss out on the play-offs, while they were then hammered 5-0 by France in a friendly, and lost 2-1 to Morocco in a game in which goalkeeper and captain Ronwen Williams stood in the way of a far more embarrassing defeat.
