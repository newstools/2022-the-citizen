Formula 1 (F1) will be returning to the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal for the Canadian Grand Prix for the first time since 2019. Here’s when to watch Free Practices, Qualifying, and the race. Despite Mercedes’ troubles and team boss Toto Wolff’s comments on Hamilton’s W13’s porpoising issues, it’s all systems go for this weekend.  The Citizen’s F1 columnist John Floyd – after initial testing in Barcelona –  wrote about Lewis Hamilton’s “uncontrollable porpoising”. Floyd explains: “Many of the teams appear to have placated the violent movement but very few have found an absolute cure. Mercedes face continuing issues, particularly when track surfaces are undulating as witnessed in Monaco and Baku”. Free Practice sessions will be screened on SuperSport Channel 215 and will take place at the following South African times:  The Qualifying can be viewed on SuperSport on Saturday at 22:00. Meanwhile, the race itself will take place on Sunday, 19 June at 20:00.  World champion Max Verstappen led a Red Bull 1-2 in Sunday’s Azerbaijan Grand Prix in a potentially key moment of the title race after Charles Leclerc and Ferrari endured another dose of raceday misery. Sergio Perez had jumped pole sitter Leclerc to the first turn before Verstappen took control as first the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz and then Leclerc retired with engine problems. George Russell took third with teammate Lewis Hamilton fourth for Mercedes who suffered badly from bouncing on the streets of Baku this weekend.
