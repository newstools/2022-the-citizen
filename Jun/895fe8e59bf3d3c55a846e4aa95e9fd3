With the introduction of its performance pair the i30 N and Kona N in April, Hyundai became the latest carmaker to throw down the gauntlet to the VW Golf GTI, South Africa’s undisputed king of hot hatches. Despite only the i30 N really being a hatchback and the Kona N being a crossover SUV, under the skin they are identical. Both are powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine which sends 206 kW of power and 392 Nm of torque to the front wheels via an eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox. The Korean carmaker claims the i30 N can reach 100km/h from a standstill in 5.4 seconds and that the Kona N can go from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.5 seconds. If those numbers can be backed up on the drag strip, the Golf GTI might be in a spot of bother. The eighth reincarnation of one of Mzansi’s most sought-after badges clocked a seriously impressive 5.88 seconds during Road Test Editor Mark Jones’ high-performance test last year.

Mark is busy crunching the numbers which we will publish on Saturday. If the first version of the Hyundai i30 N is anything to go by, the Golf GTI might be safe.  Back in 2020, Hyundai introduced the hot hatch locally for the first time, claiming it is capable of completing the 0 to 100 km/h sprint in 6.1 seconds. But Mark’s test results of 6.52 seconds fell way short. For more information on the Hyundai Kona, visit the manufacturer’s website.
