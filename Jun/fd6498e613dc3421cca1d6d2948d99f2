South Africa has officially ended all Covid-19 containment regulations in the country, including the wearing of masks indoors and in public settings, limits on gatherings, and border checks. This comes after Health Minister Joe Phaahla repealed the regulations with a notice in the Government Gazette. “I, Mathume Joseph Phaahla, Minister of Health hereby repeal Regulations 16A, 16B and 16C of the Regulations Relating to the Surveillance and the Control of Notifiable Medical Conditions, made in terms of sections 90(1)(1), (k) and (w) of the National Health Act, 2003 (Act 61 of 2003), and promulgated on 4 May 2022 under Government Notice 2060, in their entirety.” “The repeal of the Regulations concerned will come into operation on publication in the Gazette,” Phaahla wrote in the notice. In a letter to MECs dated two days ago, Phaahla said “current epidemiological analysis points towards lower infection rates and that the country has exited the recent spike (5th wave), which the current limited regulations were promulgated to mitigate.” ALSO READ: Government’s move to scrap Covid-19 regulations positive for SA’s economy – expert Phaahla will join the Minister in the Presidency Mondli Gungubele for a press briefing on Thursday.
