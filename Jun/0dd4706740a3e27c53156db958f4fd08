South Africa’s World Cup-winning coach and director of rugby Rassie Erasmus said his Twitter account was hacked after a porn clip was retweeted from his account on Friday night. Erasmus apologised to his followers shortly before 6am on Saturday morning after being made aware of the tweet. “Sorry guys about that inappropriate tweets! The handle has been hacked!” A few hours later, Rassie took to Twitter again, saying the “hackers still seem to have the retweet from earlier appearing in some places although it has been deleted on my side and reported”.  “Hopefully my account will be sorted shortly”, he added. While some didn’t buy the ‘hackers’ story, others came to Rassie’s defence. One netizen replied: “There are hackers sending jokes via messenger. If you click on a link in messenger they can hack your account.” Erasmus and Springbok head coach Jacques Nienaber are currently preparing for the start of the first national training camp from Monday.  Several players not involved in the United Rugby Championship playoffs will take part in the camp before more players join when their franchise teams are done with their URC commitments. The Boks’ first action of 2022 is against Wales in a three-Test series in July. They will then play in the Rugby Championship before touring Europe at the end of the year.
