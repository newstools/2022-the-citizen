The Pumas claimed a historic first Currie Cup title victory when they beat their hosts, Griquas, in the final in Kimberley on Saturday afternoon. Built on a solid defensive performance, Jimmy Stonehouse‘s me were simply too good for Griquas, who were playing in their first final since 1970. The men from Mbombela also took the chances that came their way, while Griquas were unable to convert all their opportunities. 24th minute: After more than 20 minutes of the teams settling down, outstanding Pumas fullback Devon Williams takes a long pass from his No 10 Tinus de Beer to score in the corner. While the floating pass out wide looked to be slightly forward, the TMO Quinton Immelman ruled it good. 38th minute: The ever reliable Griquas player George Whitehead had a game to forget. At a restart he kicked directly into touch and from the turnover on halfway, the Pumas moved downfield into Griquas territory and from a penalty win they scored their second try through hooker Eduan Swart.
