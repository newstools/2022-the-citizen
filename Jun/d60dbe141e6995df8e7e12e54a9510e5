AmaZulu FC president Sandile Zungu has confirmed the arrival of Ethan Brooks and Rally Bwalya as the DStv Premiership side continues to bolster their squad for next season. The club has made a total of eight new signing so far and AmaZulu president says there are two more players they are busy negotiating with. Brooks arrives from TS Galaxy, while Bwalya joins Usuthu from Tanzanian club Simba SC and the AmaZulu president says he is glad that the team has managed to secure the players so soon. “We are very delighted that so soon after the 2021/22 season we’ve got so busy in the transfer market. You would have seen us announcing six signings, now we have included two additional players, that makes it eight.
