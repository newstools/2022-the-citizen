Bafana Bafana head coach Hugo Broos has blasted the quality of football in the Premier Soccer League, saying that national team simply do not have the players to compete with the top nations on the continent.

A miracle can happen but those are coincidences.” Broos indicated, however, that he will take a similar squad to the one that faced the Atlas Lions to the home-and-away qualifiers against Liberia in September. “Let’s believe in the group that played against Morocco. I believe in them. I know we will be be motivated to win twice against Liberia, and it is possible. We aren’t playing Morocco.”
