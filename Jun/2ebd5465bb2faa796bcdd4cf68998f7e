BEST BET RACE 6 NO 1 PROPHET- WIN This is a very decent horse and has won both his starts, including a Grade 3 feature at Scottsville last time. He has won both races with ease. Is perfectly drawn and is described by trainer Corne Spies as “the real deal”. Worth a good punt. VALUE BET RACE 3 QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT 11-ROCKIE REEF AND 13-ISLA MORADA WITH THE FIELD We are taking a bit of a gamble with this bet but if it does arrive, we are guaranteed a really good payout. Both Rockie Reef and Isla Morada are around 12-1 and as there is no clear favourite whatever comes in with them will also be at decent odds. This is not a cheap bet and will cost R187.20 for 10%, but one can also take as little as 1% for R18.80.
