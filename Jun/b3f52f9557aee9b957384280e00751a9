The South African Post Office is warning the public to be wary of another scam that targets credit card details, where people are made to deposit money to release a package. According to the Post office the scam involves emails and SMS messages which appear to come from them, when in fact they are from crooks. Scammers have been tricking South Africans into paying money into a fraudulent account, while also unknowingly sharing the details of their credit card with the scammers. In the messages, there is a link that leads to a payment page, where people are asked to deposit money into the scammers’ account on order to release a package. Other links also include a data harvesting farm, which requires the user’s card number and the security number (CVV) at the back of the card. If you do fall victim to their tricks, the scammers will be able to exhaust your credit limit, as both the card number and the CVV number is required in order for the user to purchase something online. Anyone with information about postal crimes, can contact the Post Office’s toll-free crime buster hotline on 0800 020 070. NOW READ: Fake news: Sassa is not running a Covid-19 promotion
