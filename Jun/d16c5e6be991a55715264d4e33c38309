There were a few surprises when weights for the 2022 Hollywoodbets Durban July were published on Tuesday – and not due the handicappers. The biggest shock was jockey Piere Strydom being declared to ride former July winner Belgarion for trainer Justin Snaith. Strydom has been out of action with injury issues for many a long month and was not considered likely to be fit for the R5-million race at Greyville on Saturday 2 July. Also raising eyebrows was the declaration of another former champion, S’Manga Khumalo, to ride two horses – Jet Dark for Snaith and Sparkling Water for keen rival Mike de Kock. Will they arm-wrestle for the services of “Bling”? Another surprise was the name of Callan Murray, who has been riding successfully in Hong Kong in recent months. He is down to ride De Kock’s Gold Challenge winner of Saturday, Al Muthana. Muzi Yeni has been named by De Kock to partner ruling July ante-post betting favourite Safe Passage, recent winner of the Daily News 2000. Freelance ace Richard Fourie gets the booking on joint-second favourite Pomp And Power for Snaith, while Craig Zackey is engaged for another Snaith hopeful, Hoedspruit. Aldo Domeyer was declared by Snaith aboard his two-time July winner Do It Again.Then the re were the weights. But not any surprises.Defending champion Kommetdieding and dual Queen’s Plate winner Jet Dark have been allocated joint top impost of 60kg for the Grade 1 contest over 2200m. The current 7-2 favourite Safe Passage is set to carry 54.5kg, while joint-second favourites Pomp And Power and Sparkling Water have 53kg and 53.5kg respectively. There was one supplementary entry – Andre Nel-trained Airways Law, who won the Saturday’ Grade 3 Cup Trial at Greyville, a “preferential” race for the July selection panel. Owner Sabine Plattner paid a non-refundable fee of R30,190 for the privilege of being considered for the final line-up, though, strictly on merit rating, he is unlikely to crack the nod. A total of 35 horses remain in contention for the 18 July running slots, plus two reserves. The final declarations deadline is Monday 20 June at 11am, and the next day final line-up will be announced and the barrier draw made live on television. The official, televised July gallops will be held at Greyville on the morning of Thursday 23 June.
