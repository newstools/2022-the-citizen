Join in on the global celebration of World Environment Day by trying out these effective ways in which you can contribute to better the environment. Turn off all the lights and plugs which are not in use when leaving a certain room or your home for a few hours.

Make use of this water to water the plants and grass in your garden. This decreases your water consumption on a monthly basis as you will not need to use any fresh water from the taps to water your harden.  Doing your laundry often also has a major impact on the environment, because of the amount of water which is used to wash your clothes in the washing machine. The wear and tear of clothes that happens from regularly washing your clothes also results in you buying new clothes and repeating the cycle, as well as using more electricity each month with your tumble dryer. To decrease your water and electricity usage each month from doing laundry, you could wear certain clothing items more than once, such as jackets, jeans, and jerseys.  You can also wash your laundry ahead of time and dry your clothes indoor on a clothing rack to ensure that your dryer does not need to always be used.
