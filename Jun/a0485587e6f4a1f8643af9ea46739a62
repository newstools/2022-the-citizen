Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says government is making progress on the construction of the Msikaba Bridge – South Africa’s new mega-bridge project in the Eastern Cape. The Msikaba Bridge forms part of government’s N2 Wild Coast Road Project that connects four provinces, namely the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga.

Some 410km of route stretches from the Gonubie Interchange near East London to near Port Edward, and to the Mtamvuna River at the KwaZulu-Natal border. On Monday Mbalula shared pictures of the construction projection on social media. The minister said once construction is completed, the bridge will spur economic activity, community development, service delivery and job creation. “The project will continue to create thousands of new jobs and economic opportunities in line with the new Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan,” he said.
