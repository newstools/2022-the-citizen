FAIRVIEW POLYTRACK BEST BET RACE 1 NO 5 EMILY’S SPIRIT – WIN This filly has a record of five runs with four second places. Her best performance was over this course and distance and it could come as a shock if Alan Greeff’s charge cannot finally shed her maiden tag. VALUE BET RACE 7 NO 1 BIG BAY – EACHWAY Big Bay’s last two runs have been on the turf and they were not all that great. However, he loves the Polytrack and over this course and distance he has a record of six wins and four places from 13 starts. There has been a bit of nibble at his opening price of 25-1 but now at 12-1, Big Bay should still provide decent value in a field where he is the best handicapped runner.
