The Azerbaijan Grand Prix – which takes the 2022 season into round eight this weekend – will be delayed ever so slightly. Here’s when to watch the F1 qualifying in Baku on Saturday.  Sergio Perez set the fastest lap in the final practice session with 1’43.170; just 0.016s faster than Charles Leclerc in the Ferrari. Leclerc will be aiming for the fourth pole position while Lewis Hamilton is hoping to claw back something from a “nightmarish campaign”.  This after Hamilton battled porpoising issues with his Mercedes W13 during practice, while George Russell ended in seventh place on Friday. Russell lamented how Ferrari and Red Bull “just have an inherently faster car than us”. “We’ve done everything we can to try and catch up”, he said.  Meanwhile, Max Verstappen ended the final practice session in third position. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

As reported by Andrew Benson back in May, drivers are still “dissatisfied” with the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) decisions this season. When asked at a press conference if they were “happy and satisfied” with how the FIA president was handling matters, “none of them wanted to answer”.  Benson said: “It was really awkward… Long story short, no one is really happy with the FIA at the moment.” ALSO READ: Sergio Perez claims ‘dream’ win at Monaco Grand Prix
