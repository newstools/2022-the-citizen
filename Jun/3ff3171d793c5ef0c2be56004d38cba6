The Khunes got married in December 2019 in a traditional wedding which took place soon after the soccer star paid lobola for his bride. In February 2020, the couple welcomed their first daughter, Amogelang Zanande Khune. During an interview with TshisaLIVE, Sphelele revealed that she wanted two more children, but said that Khune advised for them to only have two children because he believed in “balancing the equation”. “I want three, but my husband believes in balancing the equation,” said Mrs Khune.  The following year, Itumeleng and Sphelele added a new member to the Khune clan after welcoming their second daughter, Lesedi Ziyanda Khune.
