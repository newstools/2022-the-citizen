The Lydenburg Magistrate’s Court has fined the Thaba Chweu Local Municipality in Mpumalanga R10 million for contravention of environmental laws. This after the community of Mashishing had complained since 2011 about sewage spillages and contaminated water flows. The municipality entered into a plea bargain agreement with the state and pleaded guilty to seven counts related to the contravention of the National Water Act, after the Department of Water Affairs and Environmental Affairs brought a docket to the NPA for a decision to institute criminal charges.
