Boxing fans were left stunned, traumatised and concerned after South African boxer Simiso Buthelezi was left punching at an invisible opponent in a fight in Durban at the weekend, after seemingly losing his bearings. After knocking his real opponent, Siphesihle Mntungwa, through the ropes in the 10th round of their World Boxing Federation African lightweight bout, Buthelezi seems to lose sight of the knocked out man and he instead focuses on the referee and corner cushion. He then starts throwing punches – at thin air. Buthelezi swings at nothing until the referee stops the fight. Mntungwa was later declared the winner by TKO. Very scary in South Africa please ???????? for Simiso Buthelezi (4-1). At 2:43 of the 10th & final round, Siphesihle Mntungwa (7-1-2) falls through the ropes but then Buthelezi appears to lose his understanding of the present situation.

According to The Sun, Buthelezi was put into an induced coma after the fight.
