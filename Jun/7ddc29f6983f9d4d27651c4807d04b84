The club would like to wish the players well in their future endeavours.”   Pirates confirmed last week that Gabadinho Mhango and Thulani Hlatshwayo will not be a part of the team going forward. Mhango joined AmaZulu in a deal for Xoki while Hlatshwayo asked to be released and his wish was granted.
