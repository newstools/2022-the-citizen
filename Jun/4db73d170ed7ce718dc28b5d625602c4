Duvenhage said Ramaphosa needs to get proper control over the ANC and stabilise the forces within the party. He said there is a lack of decisive leadership by Ramaphosa and that he is functioning as an agent of the ANC instead of providing the type of independent transformational leadership the country needs at the moment.
