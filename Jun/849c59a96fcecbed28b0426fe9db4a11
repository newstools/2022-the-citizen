Youngsta CPT has helped shaped the Cape Town rap and hip hop culture and is now dabbling in the sneaker culture with a flare of drill music sub-genre.  The Cape Town-based star is a man of many talents and who has made business moves outside music.  His latest move is in sneakers, which makes sense in hip hop, as sneaker culture was popularised in the 80s and 90s in African American hip-hop culture.  From Run DMC releasing their ground-breaking track, My Adidas in 1986, many artists from Diddy, Kanye ‘Ye’ West, and Beyonce have partnered with sports brands by having their own custom sneakers and referencing these icon brands such as Nike’s Air Jordans to Puma in their songs.  Raf Don and Youngsta CPT are no different and have created their song to mark Cape Town’s sneaker culture through Tekky, released on Friday, 24 June on all streaming platforms.
