Russia is holding more than 6,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war, the defense ministry said Thursday, a day after the two sides swapped imprisoned soldiers. “The total number of Ukrainian troops captured or who surrendered is more than 6,000,” Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the ministry, said in a statement. On Wednesday each side received 144 detained soldiers.

The Ukrainian defense ministry said most of the Ukrainian soldiers had been seriously wounded. Konashenkov said of the troops returned to Russia: “nearly all of those freed are wounded or gravely wounded. They are receiving necessary medical care.” His statement marked Russia’s confirmation of the swamp, a day after the pro-Moscow separatist leader in east Ukraine, Denis Pushilin, had done so.
